Lasik Eye Surgery,"A few years ago, I finally decided to get Lasik Eye Surgery.  I had been going to the same eye doctor for a few years, and she told me I was a good candidate for it.  She tells me I need to get a topography test which couldn't be done at her office.  Instead, she sent me to the Eye Center at a local hospital.  While I was there, I asked if this was same building I would go when it came time for the actual procedure.  They confirmed that it was.

The time for the surgery came, and I show up at the same wing of the hospital, which was rather large.  They apologized and said I was in the wrong building.  I actually needed to go across the street which was a main road but was still considered part of the hospital.  I asked the name of the building I was looking for, and they said it was the Urology building next to a Starbucks (go figure).  I asked, ""Are you sure?  I have to go to the Urology Center for eye surgery?""   
 Apparently, the Urology Center was the only building with rooms large enough to house the machine they used to perform the surgery.

The Monk Story,"A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night? The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a very strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, The same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks again accept him, feed him, and again fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, We can't tell you. You're not a monk.

The man says, All right, all right. I'm dying to know.

If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?

The monks reply, You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk. The man sets about his task. Some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

He says, I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.

The monks reply, Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.

The monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, The sound is right behind that door. The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.

He says, Real funny. May I have the key? The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.

The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.

Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, And so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks say, This is the last key to the last door.

A traveler was walking along the side of the road hitchhiking on a dark night in the middle of a thunderstorm,"Time passed slowly and no cars went by. It was raining so hard he could barely see his hand in front of his face.

Suddenly he saw a car approaching, moving slowly and appearing ghost-like in the rain. It slowly and silently crept toward him and stopped.

Wanting a ride very badly, the guy jumped into the car and closed the door; only then did he realize that there was nobody behind the wheel, and no sound of the engine to be heard over the rain.

Again the car crept slowly forward and guy was terrified, too scared to think of jumping out and running. The guy saw that the car was approaching a sharp curve and, still too scared to jump out, he started to pray and beg for his life. He was certain the ghost car would go off the road and into the river, and he would surely drown!

But just before the curve, a shadowy figure appeared at the driver's window and a hand reached in and turned the steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. Then, just as silently, the hand disappeared through the window and the hitchhiker was alone again.

Paralyzed with fear, the guy watched the hand reappear every time they reached a curve. Finally the guy, frightened nearly to death, had all he could take and jumped out of the car and ran through the storm to the nearby town.

Wet and in shock, he went into a lighted tavern and with voice quavering, ordered two shots of whiskey, and then, shaken, he told everybody about his supernatural experience.

A silence came over those listening and everybody got goose bumps.

They realized the guy was sober and was telling the truth. And the sounds of the storm continued outside.

About a half hour later, two guys walked into the bar and one says to the other, 'Look Billy Bob, there's that idiot that rode in our car while we was pushing it in the rain.'

How my Husband and I Terrified a Taxi Driver," My husband and I were dressed and ready to go out for a lovely evening of dinner and theatre.

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""",Jokes,1552085196,dontneedurl,12,175,True,2019-03-08,0,"How my Husband and I Terrified a Taxi Driver  My husband and I were dressed and ready to go out for a lovely evening of dinner and theatre.

Dave was bragging to his boss one day," ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

The  Dane says: ""Well, I also have a problem. My owner is a beautiful blond with a perfect body and I get super aroused every time I see her. Just the other day, she came out of the shower completely naked and was drying herself off in the bedroom. I couldn't stop myself. I knocked her onto the bed, raked her back with my paws and started humping away. It was crazy.""

""Oh man"", say the other two. ""So you also getting the snip?"", they ask.

The Dane responds: ""Hell no, I'm getting my nails trimmed"".

The daughter replied, ""I'm 35 and still living at home with my parents and this is the closest I'll ever get to a husband.""

 

A couple of days later the mother heard the humming sound again, this time in the living room. In there, she found her husband watching the Super Bowl on television with the vibrator buzzing away beside him.

 

""What are you doing?"" she exclaimed.

 

He replied............""Watching the game with my son-in-law."""

The Talking Cat.,"A 2 bit magician had a show called ""Goldie, the Magic Talking Cat"".  He wasn't that skilled of a magician, so he had to make up for his lack of talent with cheesy 2 bit tricks.   

He found this cat that looked like it was clearly abandoned.  It had fleas and ticks, wasn't fixed and it didn't have a collar.  

So he adopted the cat, cleaned it up and got the cat fixed.   

He gave him the name ""Goldie"" because of his golden orange  fur.  

So he had an idea on how to make money from his new pet.   He was going to advertise his pet as ""a talking cat"" and take it to magic shows.  The cat loved to meow all the time, so he thought he could make his money off of the cat's meows.  

The man showed off his talking cat at his show.   He had his tip jar ready.   

After a few mundane magic tricks, the man pulled out the main attraction: The talking cat.   

He then asked the cat ""Hey Goldie, what's the name of one of China's former leaders?""
The cat said ""Mao""

The crowd chuckled and thought it was cute. A few people tipped him.  But they still wanted to see the cat speak.  

The man did a magic trick in front of the cat.  The disappearing kitty treat.  
The cat then went ""Wow"".   

""See that?"" the man cried.  ""That cat said wow!""

The crowd rolled their eyes.  He got a few coins in his tip jar for the trick itself.   

The magician, sensing that the crowd would turn on him, got desperate.  

""Hey Goldie, where does milk come from""

The cat then said ""Cow""

The crowd walked off and groaned.

As the crowd walked off, the cat said ""Some cultures drink goat and sheep's milk.  We just drink cow's milk in America due to cultural differences.  Also, I would say the Wu Sangui was a former Chinese leader, but few Westerners know of his existence.  And I didn't want to swear in front of the kids, so I said 'wow'  The tip jar is this way, folks.  Thanks for rescuing me, by the way, magic man!""

A priest told me this joke as a kid.,"There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.

They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.

&amp;#x200B;

One day the 3 of them were given great news.

Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: 

""Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!"". Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:

""Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!"". Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: 

""Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!"".

&amp;#x200B;

They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks 

""Where are we?"". The angels says:

 ""Congratulations, you made it to heaven"". The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. ""Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it"". Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, 

""What's wrong?"". Chester finally speaks up, 

""Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day"". The angle replies to them, 

""No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it"". The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,

""This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends"". The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,

""What's wrong?"". Chester responds with,

""My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area"". The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,

""Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here"". Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.

&amp;#x200B;

The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, 

""This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you don't want to live alone"". The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask,

 ""So, uh... What's the rent here?"". The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies

 ""Nothing? It's free"". Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,

""Wow! That's so kind of you guys!"". Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,

""What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?"". Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, 

""If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert. We could've been here 20 years ago!"".

&amp;#x200B;",Jokes,1552136338,SyrupOnWaffle_,35,444,True,2019-03-09,0,"A priest told me this joke as a kid. There were 3 men, they were best friends, and they were quite unhealthy. Their names were, Bert, Chester, and Earl.

They were actually really unhealthy and Bert decided that he needed to take charge of him and his friends' health. He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible. He broke the news to his friends, and they weren't too happy about it, but they decided to go along with it anyways, because they knew how out-of-shape they all were. It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.

&amp;#x200B;

One day the 3 of them were given great news.

Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: 

""Guys! My daughter just had a child! I'm going to be a grandpa!"". Everybody was celebrating for Bert when Earl got a call from his son. He answered it, and turned around to everybody and said:

""Guys! My son is going to get married today! I'm so excited!"". Everybody was now celebrating for Bert and Earl, when Chester got a call. He answered it, turned around and said to everybody: 

""Guys! My family is having a reunion today! I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!"".

&amp;#x200B;

They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck. It killed all three of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The three of them wake up together in heaven. They notice an angel standing over them and one of them asks 

""Where are we?"". The angels says:

 ""Congratulations, you made it to heaven"". The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. ""Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it"". Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, 

""What's wrong?"". Chester finally speaks up, 

""Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day"". The angle replies to them, 

""No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it"". The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,

""This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends"". The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,

""What's wrong?"". Chester responds with,

""My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area"". The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,

""Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here"". Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.

&amp;#x200B;

The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, 

""This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you don't want to live alone"". The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask,

 ""So, uh... What's the rent here?"". The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies

 ""Nothing? It's free"". Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,

""Wow! That's so kind of you guys!"". Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,

""What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?"". Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, 

""If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert. We could've been here 20 years ago!"".

P:  Uh huh, go on...
C:  And, uh, there is usually a big fuzzy rabbit with a basket of eggs.
P:  Yes, yes, what else?

The cardinal is encouraged at this point so he steps up his game.

C:  That's also the day our Lord Jesus rose from the tomb.

The Pope's eyes light up and he nods and smiles.  The Cardinal sees this and gets excited.

C:  That's right, he rose from the tomb and rolled back the rock!  And if he sees his shadow, he runs back in and we get six more weeks of winter!"

For extorting from me and my fellow Americans $4,000,000,000.00 a year for the last 4 decades, we bless thee.

For taking our most sophisticated weapons technology and stealing it for yourself without paying the American patent holders, we bless thee.

For taking that high-tech military technology and selling it to our enemies, such as the Russians and Chinese, thus further endangering us, we bless thee.

For using that weaponry in a sustained attack against a United States ship, the USS Liberty, in an attempt to sink her, thus preventing US servicemen from revealing to the rest of the world information concerning the war crimes they witnessed you commit against Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Desert during the Six Day War, as well as for the purposes of dragging the US into yet another one of your murderous adventures, we bless thee.

For killing 35 and wounding 170 American sailors aboard the USS Liberty, we bless thee.

For bribing the United States government into covering it up, preventing any justice from being done for the benefit of the families of the lost sailors – as well as the American People, we bless thee.

For sending your agents into Egypt and blowing up American buildings for the purpose of blaming the Arabs in an event known as the Lavon Affair, we bless thee.

For sending your agents into Libya during the Reagan administration, and broadcasting radio messages in Arabic that were designed to sound like “terrorist cell planning” so that the US would initiate military strikes against Khadafi in an event known as Operation Trojan Horse, we bless thee.

For withholding information from us concerning the planned attacks against the US Marine barracks in Lebanon, attacks you knew about through your moles in the Islamic world and about which you deliberately refused to warn us in order to further your interests against the Arabs, we bless thee.

For employing Jonathon Pollard, an American serviceman paid to spy for Israel in order to steal even more of our National Security secrets for your parasitic purposes, we bless thee.

For breaking every agreement you have made with your Arab neighbors, stealing their land, displacing, murdering, and treating them like the animals you see them as, we bless thee.

For using your agents within the first Bush administration to involve us in the first Gulf War, causing the deaths of American men and women, and exposing our servicemen to whatever bio-weapons were and are responsible which have led to Gulf War Syndrome, we bless thee.

For your role in the September 11 attacks in this country, and for blackmailing and bribing the US government into deporting back to Israel the 100 or more intelligence agents that were arrested after the attacks, we bless thee.

For suppressing the information from the American people of your involvement in the September 11 attacks and sending us in the wrong direction in search of answers, we bless thee.

For using one of your agents in the US Army Weapons Lab to steal anthrax and distribute it into our mail system, terrorizing US citizens and killing several in order to blame the Arabs, we bless thee.

For using your agents in the US Government, namely, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, and the rest into initiating this war in the Middle East so that you could bring to heel all the enemies you have made during the last 50 years, we bless thee.

For using your agents in the media to lie to us on a minute by minute basis about the war, lying to us as to how “just” this cause is, and what the real reasons behind it are, we bless thee.

For using your agents in the Christian Evangelical community, such as Falwell, Graham, Swaggert, Robertson and the rest who praise you as God’s chosen people and further keep Americans in the dark about who you really are what you have done, and what you are truly about, we bless thee.

For bringing idiots like Limbaugh, Liddy, Hannity, Beck, O’Reilly and Savage to the forefront as paid liars who will support you and further lead Americans astray, we bless thee.

For making America your attack dog, and for sending her sons and daughters to fight and die in all your future wars, we bless thee. For using your influence in the media to hide the real statistics about the war, the dead and wounded on both sides, we bless thee.

For using us in such a way that not only further inflames the Arab world against us, but as well has succeeded in our alienating ourselves against those nations with whom we have been friendly for over a century, we bless thee.

And finally, for using your influence in our media and academia to flood our minds with pornography and lies, as well as inculcating in us a hatred for our history, religion, and culture, for dividing our nation between races and sexes, and for releasing into our society all of your plagues and filth that have left us a rotted out corpse of a once great nation, oh Israel, our friend,

The Mysterious Bottle of Ketchup,"A man wants to throw a party, so he heads into a grocery store looking for supplies. He grabs a shopping cart and combs through the aisles, grabbing everything he could possibly need for the party. 

He's about to head out and he does a final mental check of the things he needs. He realises he forgot to buy extra condiments. He finds the aisle where the condiments are, and fills his cart with everything imaginable. He buys soy sauce, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch, the lot.

Finally, he arrives at the end of the aisle where the ketchup is stored, and scans through the seemingly endless assortment of tomato sauces. ""Low sugar"", ""Garlic and Herb"", ""Low salt""... The selection is absurdly broad. After spending some time looking through each one, he eventually finds a solitary bottle at the back of the shelf which  is labeled as ""vision  enhancing ketchup"".

 He checks the back of the bottle and it claims to be filled with special nutrients and essential oils which  will give even the most visually impaired of people hawk-like vision. Unable to resist, he adds the exorbitantly expensive bottle of mysterious ketchup to his shopping cart and heads to the checkout. 

Being a meticulous spender, he knew more or less what the total was going to be, so when the cashier told him that his party supplies had cost him $240.45, he was taken aback. 

""Surely it isn't more than $225... can you show me the receipt?"" 

The cashier prints the receipt and he scans it, quickly realising the problem. 

""This simple bottle of tomato sauce is $19.50?!"" 

The cashier replies "" Well, actually, after tax it's $20.20."" 

The man is visibly furious. 

""Hey man, I don't set the prices, do you want it or not?"".

Indignantly, he decides to  purchase it anyway, thinking to himself ""oh man this ketchup better be really fucking good"". He heads home and starts preparing for the party. The next day after work, the guests begin to arrive. The whole affair is an instant success. Everyone is laughing, drinking and eating and having a grand old time. 

Eventually, the man gets a little peckish and heads over to the table with the assorted barbecued meats and makes himself a hotdog. He adds all the trimmings - cheese, slaw, onions, even a little bacon, and to top it all off, he decides to crack open the mysterious and enigmatic bottle of ""vision enhancing ketchup"". 

He adds it to his hotdog, takes a bite, and is immediately disgusted by the putrid taste of the sauce. It's absolutely vile. The stench fills his nose and makes his eyes water, he is immediately overcome with nausea and dizziness and is helpless to resist the urge to spit the mouthful out onto the ground. As he coughs and splutters, his friends rush to make sure he's alright. 

""Don't worry everyone! Just some nasty ketchup, is all.""

 His friend asks 

""what on earth was wrong with that ketchup?""

 ""I don't know, it was some weird fancy stuff. It said it would make my vision better but all it did was make me nearly vomit! Such a waste of money. I definitely won't buy it again, I can tell you that much.""

"The stud rooster at a poultry farm is getting old, so the farmer buys a new one","&amp;#x200B;

Once he's arrived, the new rooster walks up to the old one and says ""Listen here, Gramps! This whole farm is mine now!"" The old rooster says ""C'mon buddy? At least let me stick around with the old hens? We'll stay in the back?"" The new rooster is adamant ""No way! All the hens are mine!"".

 The old rooster sighs, and offers a proposition: that the two of them race around the farmhouse and if the old rooster wins he can stay on the farm, if he loses then he'll leave and let the new rooster take over. 

The only catch is that since the old rooster isn't in very good shape, he needs a head start.

 So the roosters line up, the old one has his head start, and the new rooster takes off. 

As he comes round the front of the house, the old rooster is *just* in front of him. He is *so close* to beating him. He stretches out his neck and leaps forward, desperate to close the gap between them.

So I’m driving home from work...,"So I’m driving home from work and I pull onto some quiet back roads next thing I know my car breaks down.

I get out of my car and take out my phone to try and make some calls and just my luck it’s dead. 

I’m looking around trying to see something that could a help me or somewhere I could go that might have a phone. I notice a small public footpath.

I lock my car and I start walking down this footpath and after a few minutes I notice a light in the distance so I head straight for it.

I arrive at the source of the light and it’s a small wooden shack with nothing much on the outside apart from a door and a sign.

The sign reads ‘ham sandwich 10p, cheese sandwich 20p, £10 handjob’. So I’m like oh sweet maybe the person in here can help me.

I knock on the door and the most beautiful woman you have ever seen in your life answers and I say to her ‘is this sign out here right?’

The woman replies, ‘yeah baby of course it is’ 

So I reply, ‘well wash your hands a get us a cheese roll will you love’

The most terrifying horror story... ever,"As he examined the book, the owner of the shop silently approached Nester, 'Young man, you have to be really careful with this book,' says the owner, 'the content you will read, is extremely frightening.' 

Nester almost jumped when he heard the owner talking because he was too focused on the book. But with a grin on his face, he responded, 'the scarier the better.' 

The owner smiled for a bit but then became serious again, 'Good for you, but my friend, remember this, no matter what you do... no matter what happens... do not... i repeat... DO NOT look at the last page of the book... it will traumatize you forever...'

Nester nods then they proceed to the payment. The owner say it will be 5000$, and without asking too many questions, Nester hands him 50 bills of 100$. That's his salary for the past 3 months, but he wants to find out what's actually in the book.

The first thing he does after leaving the bookstore, it's running back home. He locks the door, then enters his room, closes the curtain, then opens his new book. 

And because of this curiosity, he immediately turned the book to the last page...

A joke I first heard when I was twelve years old so be warned,"There once was a little boy and, like most little boys, he was fascinated by the world but knew very little of it. This included words. Every day he learned new ones that he loved to integrate into his speech whenever he could.

For example, one day he was sitting at the kitchen table eating his breakfast cereal, when he heard his parents begin to quarrel in the adjacent room. This wasn't unusual. Mornings were usually tense as everybody struggled to get ready and out the door in order to catch the bus or beat morning traffic. The little boy was used to it, because it usually wasn't that bad anyway.

But today, his parents' voices became louder and louder and they seemed angrier than he had ever heard them. Then he heard them each say a word he had never heard before.

""Bitch!"" said his father.

""Bastard!"" hissed his mother.

The little boy frowned and tilted his head as, quite suddenly, everything was very quiet. Then his parents walked in with those usual wide, fake smiles on their faces and his mother encouraged him to hurry up and get ready for school. As he placed his dishes in the sink, he turned to his father, who was sitting at the kitchen island and sipping the last of his coffee.

""Daddy?"" he said. ""What do those words mean?""

""Which words, buddy?"" asked his father.

""The words you and Mommy said to each. Bitch and Bastard; what do they mean?""

His father choked a bit on his coffee and was careful not to spill on his work suit. 

""Oh,"" he said, coughing, ""well those words were...um...they were grown-up words.""

""But what do they mean?""

""Um...ladies and gentlemen,"" his father said, unconvincingly. Lucky that small boys don't take much convincing to believe what they're parents say. ""But you have to be a grown-up to use those words, okay? I don't want to hear you say them at school or church or anything. Understand?""

The little boy nodded, even as he turned the words over in his mind.

Another time, about a week later, the boy was sleeping when a loud thump woke him up in the middle of the night. Sitting up, he blinked his eyes open and listened for whatever it was that could have woken him from such a deep sleep.

Then he heard it, coming from his parents' bedroom. Worried, he scurried out of bed and into the hallway, listening very careful to make sure that his parents were doing alright. When he heard their voices, loud and strong, he relaxed.

Just as he was turning back to his own bedroom, however, he was struck by a couple more words that he didn't recognize. Frowning, the little boy stored them away in his mind and made a mental note to ask his parents about them tomorrow.

""What does vagina mean?"" he asked, the next day. It was Sunday and the family was getting ready for church. His mother was struggling to properly tie his bow tie, when he asked her the question and her hands froze, her eyes narrowing at him.

""Where did you hear that word?"" she asked him.

""From you!"" the little boy insisted. ""I heard you say it to Daddy last night! I also heard him say another funny word; dick. What does that one mean?""

""It means...hat,"" his mother lied, her cheeks burning. ""And vagina means...coat. But they're grown-up words, so no using them--""

""At church or school, I know,"" the boy huffed, rolling his eyes. ""It's no fun not being a grown-up. You guys get to use all the fun words.""

""That's right!"" his mother laughed. ""Now, hold tight while I get this damn bow tie fixed!""

It was no less than a week later when Thanksgiving rolled around and his father was carving the turkey while the little boy set the table for dinner. All his cousins and aunties and uncles were set to arrive at any moment and his mother had declared him a 'Big Boy'. Big enough, at least, to handle the knives without cutting himself as he placed them next to the dishes that she had already set out before running up to get dressed. 

The little--no, the *big* boy was feeling pretty grown up now. He took this responsibility very seriously and made sure to handle all the silverware with care as he set each piece next to each dish and listened to his father whistle a tune as he carved the beautifully cooked bird.

What he wasn't expecting, however, was his father's hissed declaration of ""Fuck!"" as he slipped and made a tiny incision in his finger. He quickly moved his bloody finger away from the expensive meat and ran it under water as his son turned to him.

""Daddy?"" he asked. ""What happened? What was that word you just used?""

""I just cut myself,"" his father explained. ""That's all."" The doorbell rang and he relaxed. ""Go get the door and greet your cousins,"" he ordered. ""You can finish when you get back.""

""Okay!"" The little boy set the rest of the silverware down and happily bounded off down the hall, thinking about the new word his just learned. He was proud of himself because not only was he a big boy, but he was also smart; he knew exactly what that word meant and how to use it.

When he opened up the front door, he saw several aunts, uncles, and cousins, all bundled up in their hats and coats, warding off the winter chill. He gave them a sweet smile and stood to the side.

""Please,"" he said, ""come in!"" They shuffled inside with hellos and 'aren't you such a big boy's and kisses on the forehead.

Once they were inside, the boy shut the door and turned to them with a big smile, instantly making a decision that would show everybody just how grown he had gotten since they saw him last.

""Happy Thanksgiving, bitches and bastards!"" he exclaimed, much to the shock and confusion of his family. ""May I take your penises and vaginas so we can all go into the kitchen, where my father is fucking the turkey?!""",Jokes,1546927809,cassiebones,5,1,True,2019-01-08,0,"A joke I first heard when I was twelve years old so be warned There once was a little boy and, like most little boys, he was fascinated by the world but knew very little of it.

There was this man in Bulgaria whi drove trains for a living.,"He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The six-fingered man sighs and lowers his arms ""I am prepared, my son. I have been freed from Earthly desires and acheived inner peace. I wish for nothing more than to move on to my next incarnation on the wheel of life. Strike, if that is your wish, I will not resist.""

Inigo's face darkens, he brandishes his sword, steps forward one quick light step, and thrusts the tip towards his unprotected bare chest. A hair's breadth from flesh the sword stops, quivering slightly in the fresh mountain air. Slowly Inigo lowers his sword. ""This doesn't feel right.""

""Indeed for the sutras tell us 'vengence is settled through non-vengence' you have received enlightenment and---""

""No I mean it's very anti-climatic. I spent 10 years studying fencing, I squeezed rocks for 2 hours a day to make my wrists strong, I spent another 2 hours in skipping and dodging and moving quickly to improve my footwork, 2 hours each day of sprinting as fast I could to make my legs fast and strong and every other waking hour learning the sword. I'm the first swordsman to be ranked 'wizard' since Bastia and now you're not going to try to defend yourself? Even running away would be better.""

""I'm sorry but I have renounced violence.""

""You should have done that before you killed my dad. Can't you unrenounce it? Just for a little bit? I promise it won't take long.""

""Well...""

""You owe me; you took my father and scarred me for life, i was only 10. Doesn't your Budda preach making ammends?""

The monk exhales heavily ""If it's truly what you desire, I'll get my sword.""

And so later in the self-same courtyard, in the temperate Himalayan sunshine, they face each other; the old monk and the last sword 'wizard'. Inigo attacks, a dazzling display of passion and panache, sliding with ease from one style to another: Agrippa; Bonetti; McBone! The six-fingered sword flashes and dances in his hands like sunlight on a sparkling Himalayan stream while the ix-fingered man's sword barely moves, dull and sluggish like the estuarine Ganges, spent by its long journey, turgid with the sewage of a hundred flesh-pots, longing for the final oblivion of the sea.

""This won't do"" Cries Inigo, putting up his sword, again on the point of running the six-fingered man through. ""I've lived only for this moment ever since you took Domingo from me. Fight properly.""

The old monk breathes a deep breath and regains some of his composure, again they duel, this time there is some of the old mastery and speed in the older man's swordplay but it is without passion, lacklustre. Inigo disarms him in 5 seconds flat.

""Pick it up"" Inigo says coldly switching the six-fingered sword to his left hand ""I'll waste no more of my talent upon you."" he sets to again but this time without the magical skill of the wizard. He hacks like a butcher, ugly coarse strokes, the sight of which seem to pain the old master more than the jarring impact as he guards. ""You murdering, cowardly bastard."" Inigo sneers ""I needn't have bothered learning fencing for a hack like you, a pickpocket with a homemade shiv would be more of a challenge, you ugly, mutated, freak.""

The sudden change takes both of them by surprise, a fire lights the old monks eyes for the first time in the fight as he attacks, stamping forward and taking the young Spaniard completely off guard. The monk's blade dives towards his heart and he knows he cannot stop it. The most he can hope for is a wild thrust from out of position that can never reach before he's run through himself, but might just avenge him and his father. Then just as his sword is about to strike home the six-fingered man turns his blade and instead fends off Inigo's hopeless counterattack then instantly flows into another attack.

Without thinking once, in a kind of trance, Inigo blocks him and finishes the fight with 3 simple but masterly moves. He transfixes the six-fingered man upon the six-fingered sword Domingo Montoya forged for him with supreme artistry all those years before.

""Why did try to fend off first, instead of just thrusting? You had me cold and I know you were fighting for real then"" says Inigo, dazedly ""not just humouring me""

""Well"" says the monk, with his dying breath ""You always get more karma for riposting.""",Jokes,1546938781,MansfromDaVinci,17,1,True,2019-01-08,0,"Inigo Montoya finally catches up with the six-fingered man

It had started in his teens, and while it didn't cause him physical pain, he had to put up with constant teasing about looking like an insect. It didn't help his dating life either; most girls liked him as a person but found his appearance too strange to be attracted to him.

He went from doctor to doctor trying to find answers but got none, until one day he found a doctor who confidently said he could help. ""I have good news and bad news,"" he said. ""The good news is that I know exactly what's wrong with you and can fix it with a short surgical procedure. The bad news is that I must cut your balls off."" Now the prospect didn't appeal to Brad, but he really wanted to look normal. After many a night mulling over it, he decided to return to the doctor to go through with the surgery.

The surgery went smoothly and he was discharged the following day, by which time his eyes had settled back into their sockets and actually made Brad look very handsome. He decided to celebrate his new look by getting a suit made at the tailor.

Shooting tips,"A young cowboy, sitting in a saloon one Saturday night, recognized an elderly man standing at the bar who, in his day, had been the fastest gun in the West.

Story of the gods,"One day the Hindu god shiva, wanting marijuana, was praying to another hindu god, Ganesha (his son). Ganesha answered the prayer and appeared in front of Shiva but told him he had no weed left. Ganesha had heard from a friend that Mohammed had some legit weed, so the father son duo left on a cow to score some from Mohammed.
They searched and searched and asked for Mohammed from every other person but apparently no body had seen him, not even in a photograph as even drawing him was a criminal offence. 
While talking to some guy about Mohammed, the guy told them about his dealer Jesus whose weed was top notch and even offered wine as an added bonus, they took his address and off they went.

Outside the gate of Jesus's home, they heard some feminine voices, in fact, orgasmic shouts of females. The duo looked at each other but since they wanted the weed they rang the bell. Soon the voices stopped and two women in minimalistic clothing opened the door. Shiva asked them about Jesus so they told him that he was coming. When Jesus came out of the room, the duo asked for some weed which Jesus provides them with, while handling the additional bonus wine, Shiva who wasn't able to keep it in asjed Jesus what he was doing before they arrived.

The Godfather’s relaxing at his social club...,"...with his crew. The usual gaggle of young Turks waits  in the wings, hoping to get noticed, hoping to move up.

The Godfather calls one of them over.

“Jimmy, I hear good things about you. They tell me you’re serious, that you can be trusted.”

Jimmy swells with pride.

“I got a job I need you to do for me”

“Anything you need, Godfather. Just tell me what to do.”

“I want you to go back to the john, and I want you to whack off.”

Jimmy’s silent for a moment.

“Um... excuse me, Godfather, I coulda sworn you just told me to—“

The Godfather holds up his hand, silencing him.

“Jimmy, it’s for the family.”

Jimmy snaps to attention. 

“Got it, Godfather. For the family.”

Whereupon he goes back to the bathroom. A few minutes later, he comes out, throws up his arms in a Victory salute and cries, “Mission accomplished.” Then he goes back over to The Godfather.

“So, Godfather, is there anything else I can do for you?”

The Godfather says, “You’re a good boy, Jimmy. I like your style.” Then he says, “Do it again.”

“WHAAA—!” Jimmy starts to protest. But The Godfather cuts him short with, “Jimmy, it’s for the family.”

Jimmy says, albeit dubiously, “Ok, Godfather. Whatever you say.”

This time he’s gone for a bit longer. When he comes out, he’s nowhere near as enthusiastic. Still, he goes back to The Godfather and reluctantly asks, “Is there...um... you got anything else, Godfather?”

The old man just stares at him, a slight smile at the corners of his mouth. Slowly, Jimmy gets the message. 

“Oh nooo...”

The Godfather holds up one finger. “One more time, Jimmy.”

This time, he’s in the John a lot longer. When he comes out, a layer of sweat coats his pasty skin. His eyes have a glassy look. He says to The Godfather in desperation, “Godfather, this thing you have asked of me: I’ve given it my all. I swear to you, Godfather, I have given everything I’ve got. There is nothing left to give.”

“Take it easy, Jimmy. You done good. I got something else I want you to do.”

The Knawle Family,"A girl is finally going to meet her boyfriend Dave Knawle’s family for thanksgiving. She’s really worried because she’s never had a boyfriend before, and has no idea what it’s gong to be like. Dave assures her his family will love her, and that she’ll be fine.

The girl is still incredibly nervous, but they eventually arrive at the Knawle family house. It is a grand estate, and a bit of an imposing one, but the girl buries her fears, puts on a brave face, and takes Dave’s hand. Dave reaches for the door knocker and knocks three times. The door opens, and the couple are greeted by Dave’s mom, Kaitlyn.

“Hello Dave!” Says Kaitlyn, warm and friendly. “Oh, and you must be Sabrina! It’s wonderful to finally meet you, Dave has told me so much about you! I must introduce you to everybody!” Sabrina, while still nervous, feels more comfortable around Kaitlyn, and lets her shuttle her around.

Kaitlyn introduces Sabrina to all manners of people, working their way to Dave’s young-ish cousins Ann and Mark, who have just had a child. However, when Ann shows her the child, Sabrina is taken aback. The baby looks exactly like Dave. It’s a frightening sight, but Sabrina reassures herself, thinking that they are related after all, so it’s not too weird.

After a few more people, Kaitlyn introduces Sabrina to Dave’s other married cousins, Darlene and Andy, and Isabelle and Roger. They also have recently had babies, and as Sabrina looks at them, she begins to have a full on panic attack. They both look exactly like Dave. She begins to start freaking out, and Kaitlyn asks “what is wrong?”. “These babies...” Sabrina says, barely able to get out the words, “these babies all look like Dave! It’s crazy!”.

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory,"A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore.

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.

"In High School, I had a Friend Named Ving","Back in high school, I had a friend named Ving. He and his twin sister, Ling, had recently moved here from China and so they had very traditional names. One day, Ving mentioned to me how much he hated his name.

A family of 4 goes to a Mexican restaurant...,"They get seated and are approached by a waiter. After giving their orders, chips and dip are brought out, as is customary in Mexican restaurants. As they're snacking on that, the food is taking a while to be prepared, and the father calls the waiter over.

&amp;#x200B;

Father: ""Is our food nearly ready? We ordered about 45 minutes ago.""

Waiter: ""Sorry about that sir. We've just had a change in kitchen staff. The new cook used to be a firearms salesman, so he's pretty new to this. Again, my sincerest apologies sir. Your food will be out shortly.""

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the hungry kids are devouring the chips and dip. Pretty soon, one of the kids has a puzzled expression, and says to the mother, ""I think we're out of dip."" The mother takes a quick look and sees that there's clearly a lot of it left, so she takes a chip and tries to scoop some of it up. To her surprise, the chip breaks in two. Thinking it odd, the mother says to the father:

&amp;#x200B;

""Honey, I think there's something at the bottom of the bowl.""

&amp;#x200B;

Reaching into the dip, the father pulls out a gun of all things! Stunned, he lays it on the table and demands that a waiter come over.

&amp;#x200B;

Waiter: ""Oh my...this is quite embarrassing. Allow me to get you some fresh dip. I don't know what could've happened, sir. We'll be sure to give you a full refund on your meal.""

[long] Cars fanfic 🚗,"The wind whistled into my ears whispering “You don’t belong there. You deserve better.” I think it was trying to make me feel better, but the hole that I dug myself into was still too deep for desertion. I begrudgingly flopped out of bed and closed the window, in turn blocking the wind, the only friend I had. I wiggled my tires left and right to gain traction of the ground that was soaked with my tears and I drove off into the kitchen. Opening the fridge introduced a breeze that felt warm compared to my sub-zero heart. I fumbled a can of Canada Dry around before it slipped out of my control and landed on the ground, whence I proceeded to back up over the can as a knee jerk response. As I looked down at the mess—which represented my state of being perfectly— I realized that I still had a *TRUCKHAMPTON* logo tattooed to my hood. Great, now I’m gonna have to spend money that I don’t have to get that removed.

Up until recently, I have been a part of an alternative hip hop truck-band called *TRUCKHAMPTON*. We had been close friends and we really understood each other like brothers. However, I never really belonged, because I wasn’t a truck. I hated myself because of this, because I had been deceiving the other members that I was just a pick-up truck with a truck-bed roof attachment. I felt nasty and slimy every time I rolled onto that stage, because I was singing with gas, not diesel. I wanted to get surgery to change myself into a truck, but I was too afraid that I wouldn’t be accepted by them anymore than I would be if I told them the truth.

Recently, we had all had our licences expire at the same time (because we all got our permits together,) so we went to the DMV to get them renewed. The machine at the front desk wasn’t working, so we were forced to use the backup, which meant giving our license plate numbers to the employees, who would match it with our model of car. We all sat down patiently and waited for the DMV lady to give us our plates back. Then I realized, my license plate isn’t registered as a truck! A thousand drums beat my ears and 3 elephants sat on my skull as I tensed up into a ball of raw fear. I leaped out of my seat with the force of a tsunami as soon as I caught a glimpse of the lady coming back with my plate, but I knew it was too late.

It felt like time slowed down and the universe spent an eternity twisting each of my tires while the lady uttered “Can we get the 2019 Ford Transit Connect?” I knew before the last word flew out of her front grill that my life was finished. Everything after that was a blur until now, but I’m sure this will also end up being a hazy vision in a few moments’ time.

____________________________________________

The morning sun littered through my window onto my face as if to say “fuck you, you unhappy degenerate.” And the worst part is, I can’t even disagree with that statement. I rolled past my fridge, empathizing with the week-old Canada Dry stain on the floor below the fridge. By now, so many emotions have washed trough my brain, I couldn’t remember if I did that or if someone else did, and I didn’t care to know. 

The drive to the decal parlor was as uneventful as the rest of my life will be. I rolled onto the shop and closed the door quickly to shut up the bell that chimes when a customer opens the door. “Morning!” The decal artist radiated at me, but I quickly shot down the attempt at interaction by repeating his words mockingly to him.

“Just get me the cheapest decal cleaning possible and I’ll be on my way.” Every word that left the cage of my mouth immediately reduced all emotion in the room to melancholy. The artist pulled out a jack lift station and signaled me to wheel onto it. I followed his instructions to my least effort-full extent and pulled my parking brake. I told the artist the instructions to remove the giant *TRUCKHAMPTON* logo from my hood.

“Will do.” He proceeded to equip a large pen attached to a small, computer sized machine on his desk. “This is a pretty strong laser,” he explained, “it can cause irreversible damage to your paint job, so it’s pretty damn important that you don’t move even a millimeter.”

“It’s ok, I’m used to lying still for long amounts of time with no intention of stirring.” A confused face preceded him starting up the laser machine, which whirred like a rollercoaster with a loose screw.

The shop was empty at this point. I like to believe that people just don’t need decal removals at this time of day, but I knew that I was the reason for everyone’s collective disappearance. I was exactly where I needed to be. At least I was for a good few minutes, until I heard the familiar sound of the customer bell from the door. I moved my eyes, careful enough not to move my body, as per the decal artist’s instructions, and I froze as soon as I saw who it was. Roamil.

He quietly moved into the seating area at the lobby, not noticing me. Thank god for that, I really didn’t want to deal with this. “All done!” The artist said. I gave him the money for the service and I tried to quickly move out of the store without any unwanted attention. Too bad my life has to suck. I couldn’t do it. I needed to get closure. I need to deal with this, right now.

“Roamil? Is that you?” His face immediately had the life sucked out of it as he realized who just spoke to him. “We have to talk man. It didn’t end correctly.”

“No. There’s nothing to talk about. Please, spare us both the sorrow and just leave.”

“No. I’m not gonna until we work this out. I deserve to know too R-“

“Just stop! Stop it! You lied to us. We spent every waking minute of our life thinking ‘how can we make everyone feel welcome?’ But you fucked it up! Just leave. If you deserve to know, then I deserve to not deal with this.”

“Just tell me why! I *just wanna know why*!” Please...”

After some drinks and a nice dinner out, they were walking to the bus stop to go home, when they passed by a brothel.

Little Johnny was going to school one day when,"he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

A lesson in government,"A teacher was teaching her second grade class about the government, so for homework that one day, she told her her students to ask their parents what the government is.
When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and ask his what the government was.
His dad thought for a while and answered, ''Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future.''
''I still don't get it'' responded the Little Johnny.
''Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,'' said the dad.
''Okay then...good night'' said Little Jonny went off to bed. In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying. He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there.

The Dunne Family," Some years ago, in the hills above Killarney, there lived Seamus and Isobel Dunne and their family of 6 boys.  


It was a happy but isolated existence, so it came as a bit of a shock when eldest son Niel announced that he was off to seek his fortune amongst the bright lights of London. His parents tried to dissuade him but he was focussed on this particular dream and one day in early May he duly set off after a tearful farewell to his family. All they knew was that he would be heading for London WC5 and would be writing back with news and details.  


The Summer came and went in that idyllic but changeable area of Kerry. As Autumn approached there had still been no word from young Niel and his parents were worried sick. When the local Publican, Jack, announced that he would be visiting London next week to see his brother, the Dunnes quickly persuaded him to help find out how their boy was getting on in the big City.  


Jack duly arrived at Paddington Station in London the following Tuesday armed with the information he had been give .... London WC5.  


As he strode purposefully across the concourse he noticed a sign to the right - ""WC"". He immediately made his way through the door and down the stairs where he encountered a row of small doors with numbers on.

Newton [Long],"A man called Newton goes to a Chinese restaurant. He orders some fortune cookies. When they arrive, he opens one and sees what's in it. Only one word is written:

*Newton*

Newton raises his eyes in a mixture of confusion and surprise. How the hell did that coincidence happen? Why was his name printed on that fortune cookie sheet?  He finishes his meal, the thought still on his mind. He then goes to see the chef to ask what's going on. The chef replies that he has no idea and that it must just be a mistake.

Newton forgets about the matter entirely and goes home. Several weeks later, he comes again to dine again at the Chinese restaurant, since he's gotten a bit tired of pizza. He orders a fortune cookie and some noodles. When he opens the fortune cookie, however, this odd sight greets him inside.

*Newton, but*

Now the memories of his previous visit come flooding back. It can't be a coincidence this time, surely...but the chef still insists that it must be a coincidence. He gives up, and goes home.

Months later, the man is out on a date, and he stops at the restaurant again. They both go in. He just orders noodles this time but his date orders a fortune cookie. When the cookie arrives, she opens it and gasps. She immediately shows it to the man, who almost snaps at the sight of the contents.

*Newton, but where's*

The chef still denies that this is being done on purpose, of course, and the man gives up and instead decides to treat his date to some Italian food instead. After that, the date goes splendidly. they both strike it off and they start dating more often. Some months after that, the man proposes to her and she accepts. Then a year later, the wedding is about to be held. Both the man and his wife feel like the happiest people on earth. Their union as man and wife is done and they embrace each other in a passionate kiss. After that, a grand dinner is held, but the man recognises one of the caterers there. 

""Hey, aren't you the guy at that one Chinese restaurant?"", he asks. ""Yes, sir, but unfortunately it closed down a month back, so I have become a caterer for this place"", he replies. 

The man raises his eyebrows, remembering the entire fortune cookie thing. ""Say, that whole fortune cookie thing was just a coincidence, right?"" The chef nods. ""Of course, sir! If you'd like, I can make you one right now to prove it!""

The man reluctantly agrees, and at the end of the dinner the fortune cookie arrives. He slowly opens it, trying to remember the contents of the previous ones. ""Newton, but where's""...something? Where's what? A wife, perhaps? Was this just fate's way of foreshadowing his marriage today? Of course...he gives a contented smile thinking about it. It all makes sense. Maybe he shouldn't have gotten so upset over it after all. He breaks open the fortune cookie finally, and reads it out loud in his excitement.

A man's fence is broken and he needs to hire someone to fix it,"He goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk  who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

A few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand. the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

Not happy with my company (rant),"Background:
I work as a lead project manager for a very large company. I am good at my job (or at least my yearly performance reviews say that) but I honestly don't like my job. I am regularly given failing projects and tasked with replanning the project. The stress is wearing me out. I want to work in data science - I'll have my MSc in applied statistics within the year and I'm working on creating a portfolio and getting my first data science job. I incorporate data science techniques into what I do and I credit that with what makes me successful.


Situation: 
My company is very antiquated and slow to adopt new technologies. At the end of last year they announced they were going to start embedding data analysts within teams and hire some data scientists. I thought great, here's my chance to get into the field. 


I cannot get an interview to be a data analyst because, according to the hiring manager, I don't have experience. It's frustrating because I regularly demonstrate the application of the needed skills and knowledge, but okay fine.


Fast forward a few weeks a newly hired data analyst is imbeded with my team. I try to make the best of it and think, hey, I can talk data science with this guy.


The person hired has a background as a finance analyst. He doesn't know statistics or any programming languages. He had to ask me for help writing a simple SQL query so he could put it into Excel and make a pivot chart. The hiring managers are business people who don't know anything about data science. The data analysts are being used as Excel jockies.


I don't fault the people hired as data analysts but it frustrates me that the managers have no idea what they are doing in regards to hiring and utilizing data analysts. I feel like within my company they are devaluing data science by having people not in the field doing the hiring and management of the analysts. It's looking more and more like I'll have to leave the company to work in my desired field. That will be difficult because I'll likely have to take a pay cut to get a job elsewhere.

I was having a discussion with a redditor on research vs. coursework only master's programs and PhDs. I have a tendency to get very pessimistic and negative. please help cheer me up.,"My latest comment:


Thank you so much. You've given me a lot of information, so please don't feel pressured to reply again.

With how you have worded things, it seems like the opportunity for me to do research has set and sailed. I'm 25 and want more than 3 years work experience before I turn 30 and age discrimination starts to become a serious issue for me down the road. I'm not making $60k; I'm unemployed haven't even had my first job yet.

I only did one year of unimpressive/uneventful research during my Bachelor's, so I basically have 0 (none) research experience. I've been told that, if I do a coursework based Master's when my credentials allow for a research based Master's, it will be a huge red flag.

Furthermore, I've been told that having an acceptable Coursework Only Master's GPA, Advanced 6-Sigma Certification, Years of experience in Data Analytics/Science, Letters of Recommendation based only on coursework, 0 research experience, and even Great GRE scores will make it very very unlikely to get accepted to even the lowest ranked PhD programs.

Essentially, I started applying for work in industry 3 to 5 years later than my peers and I need to catch up. I am years behind in research experience and need to catch up. I had 6 years to do research and get work experience but did not due to bad parental advice, poor time management and medical reasons outside my control.  I only get to choose to catch up in one area in the next 10 to 15 years.

Realistically...neglecting work experience is the stupidest thing I could do because I would end up in upwards of $60,000-$100,000 debt with a Master's or 31 years old with a likely average PhD and no work history. I may as well be homeless. **(Here we were talking about the sheer difficulty of working while trying to take a class for credit and do good research. I'm DQ'd from the military.)**

Maybe in 15 years when I am 40 I can start preparations for a PhD program and graduate with my PhD at 46 or later. That's up to a million dollars of lost income however if I don't work part time during the PhD as well. Sinking 4+ years into a 'lowly' Master's Degree as you put it may not be a bad thing if I am working full time and experiencing career advancement and promotions into Data Science and Management along the way.

It just seems like, if I am following an optimization toward life, doing anything with research and work autonomy has become a very net negative decision.

Part of it is that people have always called me bright, and my favorite statistics professor always said he feels I could do great things in graduate school and looks forward to reading about my accomplishments inside literature in the future.

I always really appreciated that, and part of me wants to see if that potential reality is still obtainable for me. Like, if I could do a coursework based Master's Program and get accepted into a PhD program when I've made substantial contribution to industry and want to go to the next level, that would make me overjoyed.

However, I'm told that is stupidly unfeasible. Maybe I should just focus on having a nice career and creating a happy family.

Edit: The only thought I have now is that if I go that route, I would only pusue a PhD if my future marriage deteriorated and ended in a divorce. At that point, I would need a serious change in scenery.

I've mellowed out a bit since posting this, and now have difficulting figuring out how much of this is true.

Dequindre /de-KWIN-der/ (n.): A minimalist scheduler.,"# Dequindre /de-KWIN-der/ (n.): A minimalist scheduler.

---

I'm releasing Dequindre to the open source community under an MIT license. Checkout the project if you'd like, but I'm going to talk about Dequindre as an idea that became a full solution here. Here are the links if you're interested:

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vogt4nick/dequindre/tree/0.8.1) | [PyPI Project](https://pypi.org/project/dequindre/) | [Read The Docs](https://dequindre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

---

### Why build ""a minimalist scheduler""?

A few months ago [I asked what the sub thought about current data pipeline technologies](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9uz05o/whats_your_opinion_on_current_data_pipeline/). The consensus was that Airflow was the best option, but every popular option requires significant resources to learn and implement.

I'm a data scientist working on a young product. I made that post at a time when we were unsure how to automate our data pipeline. Airflow is free, sure, but things weren't breaking yet and the time investment made Airflow an expensive option for us. We decided to point CRON jobs to shell scripts instead. It was fast, cheap, and easy to debug in the rare event of failure. It wasn't a permanent solution; it was a good-enough-for-now solution.

A revisited the problem a couple months later, and I realized there must be hundreds of teams like mine in this limbo: still unable to justify the cost of Airflow and growing too fast to rely on CRON and shell scripts. Clearly there's a need, yet there was no such scheduler that I could find. 

I started engineering my own solution. I didn't need all of Airflow's features. I thought, ""What can I take away from Airflow to make scheduling more accessible?""I took away the UI. I took away the sqlite database. I took away asynchronous scheduling, bash operator, and triggers. I kept the scheduling, dynamic configuration, python operators. I even added some functionality to support virtualenv, pipenv, and conda environments. 

What remained was Dequindre: a minimalist scheduler I could setup in minutes. It's production-capable too. We're migrating to use Dequindre on my team at work. 

### What's Next?

### Why build ""a minimalist scheduler""?

A few months ago [I asked what the sub thought about current data pipeline technologies](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9uz05o/whats_your_opinion_on_current_data_pipeline/). The consensus was that Airflow was the best option, but every popular option requires significant resources to learn and implement.

I'm a data scientist working on a young product. I made that post at a time when we were unsure how to automate our data pipeline. Airflow is free, sure, but things weren't breaking yet and the time investment made Airflow an expensive option for us. We decided to point CRON jobs to shell scripts instead. It was fast, cheap, and easy to debug in the rare event of failure. It wasn't a permanent solution; it was a good-enough-for-now solution.

A revisited the problem a couple months later, and I realized there must be hundreds of teams like mine in this limbo: still unable to justify the cost of Airflow and growing too fast to rely on CRON and shell scripts. Clearly there's a need, yet there was no such scheduler that I could find. 

I started engineering my own solution. I didn't need all of Airflow's features. I thought, ""What can I take away from Airflow to make scheduling more accessible?""I took away the UI. I took away the sqlite database. I took away asynchronous scheduling, bash operator, and triggers. I kept the scheduling, dynamic configuration, python operators. I even added some functionality to support virtualenv, pipenv, and conda environments. 

What remained was Dequindre: a minimalist scheduler I could setup in minutes. It's production-capable too. We're migrating to use Dequindre on my team at work. 

### What's Next?  

Dequindre v0.10 marks the start of ""public beta testing"" means I'll be answering public bugs, questions, and feature requests. I'll release Dequindre v1.0 when I'm confident the core functionality is tight. Right now I guess that might be April or June.

Predicting the runtime of scikit-learn algorithms,"Hey guys,  
We're two friend who met in college and learned Python together, we co-created a package which can provide an estimate for the training time of scikit-learn algorithms.

Here is our idea of the use case for this tool:  
When you are in the process of building a machine learning model or deploying your code to production, knowledge of how long your algorithm can help you validate and test that there are no errors in your code without wasting precious time.  
As far as we know there was no practical automated way of evaluating the runtime of an algo before running it. This tries to solve this problem. It especially helps in the case of heavy models when you want to keep your sklearn.fit under control.

  
Let’s say you wanted to train a kmeans clustering for example, given an input matrix X. Here’s how you would compute the runtime estimate:

    From sklearn.clusters import KMeans
from scitime import Estimator
kmeans = KMeans()
estimator = Estimator(verbose=3)
Run the estimation
estimation, lower_bound, upper_bound = estimator.time(kmeans, X)

The datascience interview process is terrible.,"Hi, i am what in the industry is called a data scientist. I have a master's degree in statistics and for the past 3 years i worked with 2 companies, doing modelling, data cleaning, feature engineering, reporting, presentations... A bit of everything, really.

At the end of 2018 i have left my company: i wasn't feeling well overall, as the environment there wasn't really good. Now i am searching for another position, always as a data scientist. It seems impossible to me to get employed. I pass the first interview, they give me a take-home test and then I can't seem to pass to the following stages. The tests are always a variation of:
*  Work that the company tries to outsource to the people applying, so they can reuse the code for themselves.
*  Kaggle-like ""competitions"", where you have been given some data to clean and model... Without a clear purpose.
* Live questions on things i have studied 3 or more years ago (like what is the domain of tanh)
* Software engineer work

Like, what happened to business understanding? How am i able to do a good work without knowledge of the company? How can i know what to expect? How can I show my thinking process on a standardized test? I mean, i won't be the best coder ever, but being able to solve a business problem with data science is not just ""code on this data and see what happens"".

Most importantly, i feel like my studies and experiences aren't worth anything.

Software engineering best practices for Data science,"Hello,

I am a doctorate engineering student aspiring to enter data science after my grad studies. I have an MS in CSE (computational science) with heavier focus on machine learning (ML theory, linear algebra etc) than CS courses.

So I realize I need to and want to build up my CS skills with regards to what would be used in a DS career. For example, from another questions yesterday, I read that documenting code using docstrings, linting etc are important. However,I am not familiar with these aspects, so is there a go-tp resource to learn these for SWE (like an equivalent for Data Science Handbook)  or just good-ol' google? 

Also what are some other aspects that a good DS should adopt from the SW world?

Thanks.

My Data Science Job Hunting Experience and Tips,"I recently got my first job as a data scientist and wanted to share some thoughts about the job hunt process and tips I found helpful for landing a first gig in the field. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background (without giving away too much PI): I had a varied education and career path to this point. Both my BSc, MSc, and PhD were in STEM fields. I decided to make the switch to data science after seeing some friends have success in the area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had no formal experience in data science/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt. 

&amp;#x200B;

To form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Interviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:

1) The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like ""why are you interested in this company"", ""how do you face challenges"", etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with ""explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it"". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice ""lecture"" about an algo, because some would just say ""explain your favorite algorithm"".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said ""do something interesting"". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say ""this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in"". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a ""template"" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Final tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (for experimental lab work I described it as lab data analysis rather than lab assistant, listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.

&amp;#x200B;

 Also I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools used for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation. As you're applying, learn something new everyday.

Best Way To Transition Into DS?,"Hey!

&amp;#x200B;

I'e recently become very interested in pursuing a career in data science, but am at a crossroads on how to approach transitioning into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on me:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a strong aptitude for math/statistics, and have no problem learning on my own. When I got my MBA, I really enjoyed the data modeling and analytics aspects of the curriculum and thrived. However, my target role after the graduating was more focused on being a product manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the technical side, I am fairly new to programming, although when it comes to programming for math-related tasks (as opposed to design-related), I tend to pick things up quickly. I've learned SQL on my own, and am picking up python at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right, I'm in a senior-level marketing position at a startup which has allowed me to build and refine a lot of 'soft skills': communication, stakeholder management and team leadership. However, this role has also made me realize how much work I have left to do on the 'hard skills' side of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've entertained the idea of going back to school: there are in-person one-year programs and 2-year online programs in my state that seem pretty well regarded. However, I've heard conflicting reports on their usefulness, especially considering how much content and expertise is available online. 

&amp;#x200B;

"For career as Data Scientist, MS in Computational Biology (CMU) or Analytics (GA Tech)?","I'm looking for thoughts and advise about Master's programs, especially from those who might have had a biological background before going into Data Science. The two options I'm looking at are Carnegie's Comp Bio, and GA Tech's Analytics/DS.  

Are DS master's programs just cash cows? Do employers prefer to see an graduate degree in a field where you pick up lots of analytical skills as opposed to a program that directly focuses on them? When two programs are similar, should the deciding factor be a school's reputation and alumni network?

#####About myself:

* Bachelor's in Genetics as well as Comp Sci, plus Math minor
* Not interested in research anymore, but did it for ~3 years 
* Applied for CMU MS DS as well, but haven't heard back yet (second wave of admission incoming, though)

I understand that either program will provide a solid basis for data science. However, I'm concerned with whether I'll be pigeonholed for only biology-related roles if I do the CMU program. I've established that I'm not interested in research or academia (hence, not pursuing a PhD), and I can see from [CMU's posted first destinations](https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/2017_one_pagers/scs/Combined_SCS_MS_2017_Final.pdf) (page 2) that only ~10% of their alumni continued in academia, whereas more than 50% of them went into DS/ML/SDE.

###Carnegie Mellon University:
* Computational Biology MS
* Stellar reputation for graduate CS (#1) and technology in general
* 2 year program
* [Curriculum](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/curriculum) has machine learning, math &amp; statistics, and elective courses like cloud computing, machine learning w/Big Data, deep learning

###Georgia Tech
* Analytics MS
* Top 10 in graduate CS (#8), great technical school
* 1 year program (fall, spring, summer)
* [Curriculum](https://analytics.gatech.edu/curriculum/computational-data-analytics-track) has a computational data analytics track that addresses visualization and has many courses relevant to the business insights side of things 

&amp;nbsp;  
I'm personally leaning towards CMU because of the length of the program (more time to absorb info + take relevant elective courses) and their repute as the number one school for computer science (should certainly help with landing a job in tech, yeah?). That said Georgia Tech's program would be directly relevant to the field I'm looking to go into and would be immensely cheaper ($70k cheaper, due to program duration + a TA-ship).

Alternate Data Science Interview Experience(s)/Perspectives,"As someone that came into the ""role"" in 2014 and is now ""senior"", I'm not an expert but I have been through a lot of interviews myself and interview panels at many companies, mostly SV tech companies.  With all of these threads popping up I figured I would share my take on the process and what I feel is or is not beneficial. **I'm going to break it down by assessment focus and then by speciality**
______
**The Phone Screen**

Believe it or not this section is extremely valuable- more than you'd realize. The HR person or junior team member you are speaking to is not a complete dunce, but they're no expert either. **If you can't explain your experiences in skills in a way that the person can understand, chances are you couldn't survive any sort of business/stakeholder meeting** with non-technical stakeholders. The number 1 issue I see lately with many very experienced candidates is they cannot explain themselves out of a paper bag if it's not a room full of technical people. Even then I've seen countless DS meetings devolve into bickering over minutiae with zero actual outcomes. **The most successful candidates regardless of speciality can flip this switch on and off with ease** and about 70% of our final round rejections are because of communication difficulties.

-**CS/Eng focus**- Usually the person on the phone has some knowledge about various stacks or often is an actual ML or Data Engineer. If you're in an org in which you deal with another Eng team, lots of time that team are not necessarily going to have the exact same skills focus. I see this a lot with Data Engineering teams in orgs that are largely worried about building product data lakes. I once sat and watched 2 people spend 30 minutes unable to speak to one another about the cache rate of a data field. Chances are if you can't convince someone that you have vaguely relevant skills or experiences in a 30min call you're going to be a pain in the ass for cross-functional partners.

-**Strategy/Finance/Business facing** Oh man, you're about to deal with a lot of people that only know about regression because of an Excel tutorial. You're going to presume that your customers are data literate, but they're far from it. If you can't give 2-3 sentence DS for Dummies answers about every part of your code or outputs, you're going to kill velocity.

-**Data Scientists** At this stage we just want to see how many projects you have successfully managed or contributed to and on what time horizon. It's too easy to throw around buzzwords or copy Kaggle code (not the worst idea for the timed take home stuff I will get to later). I'm on these panels a lot and what I **want to see are the steps you took in the process as a response to specs, iterations, or business needs.** Recruiters are pretty good at filtering out people that can't explain this succinctly.

We almost always give data that has a few columns of pure noise, some tricks (strings stored as bit64 is a really solid one people fail to identify), usually an irregular time series of some sort, and it's either a basic regression or classification problem.

What we want to see:

-If we ask for the code, we will run it. You wouldn't believe how much hacky shit we get back that does not run, has error messages, or someone decided to use a more complex method than they needed to and didn't configure specific options correctly.
-Most of the datasets are around 1-2mil records.

Dual Masters in Computer Science and Statistics at Purdue?,"Hello,

This is not my set-in-stone opinion, just based on lurking on this very subreddit (and other similar ones)— that a general opinion is that a data scientist with a deep knowledge of statistics and mathematics is more valuable than one who took a data science program that has a smattering of various courses. Not my hard opinion, just what I see here. I think it’s valuable to get input from people in the field what path to take.

I’ll also x-post this to r/statistics. I’m looking at programs very rigorous as I come from a “non-traditional” path to say the least.

How do I start building a portfolio when I am still learning programming languages?,"Just so it's clear, I'm very green. I've always been an Excel nerd and into data, so I'm doing self-study trying to learn data science basics. I'm working through a stats &amp; probability textbook and Udemy's Data Science Bootcamp.

However, all the advice I see seems to encourage people to just start making basic data visualization projects and posting them to a portfolio because the best way to learn is through actively doing projects.

Best self-study path as a math + computer science undergrad?,"Hello guys,  


I am here because I need some advice on what path to take for my studies. I feel like the options are so wide and I am a bit overwhelmed. I'll introduce myself first so you can have the ""big picture"":

# Introduction

There is a tldr for this part right after it.

I am a 21 years old male from Quebec. I was always really good with maths and have a great intuition with everything math-related (well up until Analysis 3 and CLOSED BALL IS NOT COMPACT IN C\[0,1\] WUT?) .  4 years ago I entered my university in Mathematics (actuarial sc. specialization). I figured after taking Economics and Fin. that it wasn't for me, and I really liked discrete maths and analysis so I switched for pure maths.  
I stayed in pure maths for 3 semesters and I really liked it, but I realized that it's more like a hobby than a career path for me (I really don't see myself doing research). This is where I first started gaining an interest in programming. I did not know about data science yet. I decided to change to Math + Computer Science in march, near the end of the winter semester. It was a good move since like 90% of my credits were still good.

I then spent the summer learning C++ as I didn't know in what area of C.S I would end up and I like a challenge (plus I felt like it would help me understands the core of programming more than if I would have started with say Python). Eventually I heard about data science during the semester and I knew it was made for me (I LOVE problem solving, I am good with intuition, finding the optimal way to do things, maths, etc).   
Fast forward to today and here I am: A math and computer science undergrad (but with like 3 math credits left and almost all of them in CS to do). I am pretty good with C++ (I understand well the core of the language, so I can do pretty much every intermediate-level console app assignments that I can find in books easily). I got my first programming class two semesters ago in JavaScript and I aced it since I saw everything by myself in C++ (I must say I hate JS, so web development got out of the question pretty quick). I am now doing Programming 2 in Java and it's the same story.

   I picked up ""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" by Adam Drozdek and am currently in Chapter 3. I have an overview knowledge of every main data structure and I am trying to understand it in depth with this book. It's good that it's old, because since took a modern C++ class (well free online course I mean), I can try to reimplement the examples in the book but in modern C++. I already passed the Complexity Theory chapter (it was really brieve though) and I understand it well since it's basic maths. I have a good understanding of basic Probabilities and statistics (Let's say I do well with the 10 first chapters of ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Mendenhall)

## TLDR
* Third year Math + Computer Science undergrad
* Strong pure math background (Analysis 3, differential geometry, Algebra, linear algebra, etc...)
* Core understanding of Probabilities and Stats (10 first chapters of ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Mendenhall) AND stochastics process (Markov, semi-Markov, Poisson's, etc)
* Good with problem solving
* Good with core C++ and a good part of STL
* Can code basic stuff with JavaScript, Java and Python
* Good with basic git (up to pull requests / branching)

# What next?

The reason I am here today is because I don't know where to go from there. I am really motivated, but the options I have are really wide. I am really curious about machine learning and I think I will orient myself towards it, but I'm open to other paths too.

* I could continue with my ""Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"" book (which I will probably do since it's pretty important imo
* I could start learning Python and it's libraries
* I could start learning R and it's libraries
* I could start learning machine learning (the theory)
* I could continue with C++ (Qt, SFML, other?) to understand programming more in-depth
* I could learn SQL
* I could strenghten my Probability and Statistics knowledge (Numerical Analysis? Linear Regression? Tests?)

This is my ideas right now but of course it's what *I* see, and I would like to hear YOUR opinions. I found [this image](https://i.ibb.co/C53pvQJ/Data-Science-parcours.jpg) but I'm not sure it's completely accurate and it still has many options. 
What should I do? What should I NOT do? I want to hear your opinions!

Thank you very much for reading, I know when I start I can write long texts and I'm sorry for this. I hope I hear from some of you!

Question on Linear Regression,"**Problem statement:**  
 I want to develop attribution model which will help in identifying %  contribution to the change in dependent variable, due to changes in  independent variables.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Take care of outliers, missing values, etc.
2. Transform all independent variables to be positively correlated with the dependent variable.
3. Fit a linear regression model.
4. Divide every model parameter/weight by their sum and multiple by  100. This gives % value of the weight for each independent variable  compared to sum of all the weights.
5. Now say if the dependent variable changed by 'x', then 'x' multiple  by the % of a particular independent variable will give the change  magnitude in the dependent variable due that particular independent  variable.

"[Question] Deep Learning vs. ""Traditional Machine Learning"" Usage in Industry","So I have a question regarding deep learning and more ""traditional"" machine learning usages in industry. My understanding is that deep learning is ""less transparent,"" in how it works, whereas ""traditional machine learning,"" is more transparent. This leads me to believe that for business use cases, such as for marketing, would prefer ""traditional machine learning,"" because the models can easily explain how they derived their results, whereas for a ""deep learning model,"" is less helpful if we're trying to explain why a prediction is off.

Parallelization in Python - Timeseries,"Hi,

I've written a time series outlier detection algorithm in which for each time-series I have, I iterate over the series with a lagging and leading array straddling some observation of interest. Each observation has 4 variables that I'm interested in for each iteration. I calculate the mean of the lag and lead for each step as well as some other operations / boolean statements. If some condition is met, I flag the value by appending it to a list. 

&amp;#x200B;

This step is the main bottle neck of my algorithm and it seems like something I could easily distribute across my 8-core computer, which I bought for parallelization. I'm a student but am kind of lost as to which package I should invest my time into.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two main questions:

1. What packages / services / possibly even langauges (Julia?) are worth learning?
2. In the context of the problem at hand, what is the most intuitive way to assign a process to a core? Should I assign one time series to a core at a time or distribute one time series over all of my cores? To elaborate on what I mean in the latter, for a time series with n observations I could split it into n/8 np.arrays and then do the above mentioned calculations on each core. Each iteration is independent from previous iterations so either option sounds reasonable.

Politics and Psychology of Data Science's 'Last Mile',"Dear fellow DS-Redditors,

in our company, my Data Science team is currently struggling with the 'last mile', i.e. have our insights and predictions bring about actual change.

We have sufficiently mastered the technical aspects, with APIs and platform at our disposal and available to others. Also, we've established trust with senior management executives.

What remains is to convince coworkers from other departments, e.g. sales, to work with us. Many hesitate to cooperate or to make use of our results and our work, and I feel like this boils down to a couple of human reasons:
- The generally resist change, especially when initiated by others
- Their division manager might have a long-standing rivalry with our division manager
- They see us and our suggestions/results as 'invading their territory'
- They view us as young and snobbish know-it-alls

How would you approach this problem? 

As a last measure, we could make our case with the executive level and have them pressure their guys to cooperate. However, we'd really like to solve this problem 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down'.

Cheers and thank you!

* May or may not supervise a team of data scientists
* Responsible for identifying emerging trends and their feasibility for your company, and to own the technical development of data science initiatives for your company/major function (e.g., Finance, Sales, etc.)
* Expected to be most technical person in the organization, and serve as subject matter expert for both junior data scientists and senior business leadership.
* Title expected to be Principal Data Scientist or higher (though, again, not a hard rule as some companies call their most senior data scientists just Senior Data Scientists).

**What we are asking from you:**

Once a month, we will post a thread for users to propose a question for the panel. The question with the most votes will be shared with the members of the panel through a direct message. You will then have one week to provide your answer to the question - we are expecting this to be a 2-3 paragraph exercise, so not something that requires an essay. Once you have submitted your answer, I will compile all the answers and post them to a new thread, referencing each user and their respective answer. We will the open the thread for additional commentary from the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you believe you meet the criteria and want to participate:**

\- Send me a PM with a brief outline of your qualifications (doesn't need to be much more than what is included in your flair, would be helpful to include years of experience)

OR

\- Post your qualifications on this thread (same as above)

I will compile the list manually and then begin the process once we have a critical mass of people to answer questions. I don't expect to get an overwhelming number of sign-ups, but if we do, we may change up the panel on a month-to-month basis to get everyone involved and not end up with too many answers to the same question.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them!

For the sake of having some objective definition, we are defining data science leadership as professionals that fall in one of two buckets:

**Senior Management Data Scientists:**

* Supervise a team of data scientists
* Responsible for defining overall data science strategy for company (e.g., defining career paths, building capabilities, growing the footprint of data science within the company)
* Title expected to be Director level or higher (though not a hard rule as some companies brutally undertitle their people).

For Data Visualization What is The Benefit of Python or R Over Power BI or Tableau?,"Hello all, I’ve searched for an answer to this question but I am not satisfied with some of the answers I’ve found. I’m sure Python and R probably have a lot of custom features/libraries and you could probably design some very unique visuals OR handle massive amounts of data; however, a tool like Power BI just seems so much better for everyday business needs.

I guess I’d sum up my question as: “why write lines of code in Python to create a plot, change the width of the line, add a title, and makes the bars of the values red and some blue, when you could just drag and drop? 

Finally in reporting using Python and R visualization, how do you distribute the results to customers? Export the charts to Excel? Can they be hosted on a cloud platform? I’m completely ignorant of how reporting works using Python and R visualization and I’m curious on hearing some explanations.

"Predicting Auction Prices Before Auction, Not During","Has anyone ever predicted a value (let's say price) of an auction before an auction happens? I've looked at predictive modeling on this topic but the academic research i've seen does modeling that updates as the auction happens. That's not quite what I would like to see. I'm trying to predict the final price of an item that goes through an online auction portal but i'm getting varied results that are hard to improve. These are my metrics so far with the best (what I believe is the best) model.

&amp;#x200B;

Adjusted R2 Score: 96%

MAPE: 13%

RMSLE: 0.17240 

&amp;#x200B;

The main two I am focusing on are R2 and MAPE. I honestly think the metrics aren't too bad so far but i'm trying to get them to a really impressive state. The main issue I am having is similar items (product name, condition, reviews of seller) can all be the same but final prices can be very different from one day to the next when the auction is completed. Don't know how to account for what is seemingly a random process of an item going up or down. Seasonality doesn't have much of effect. So the day of the week or month or time of the year doesn't impact it much.

EDA contemplation - What's the point and how to do it correctly ?,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

It might be dumb question ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to move beyond statistical learning theory and do something practical. I'm currently trying to perform EDA while dealing with imbalanced dataset (9:1 proportions). I've so far explored maybe 10 features out of 50 as well as their combinations, but visualy I've failed to find any sign of possible decision boundary. It's seems like class with lower share is always dominated.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that maybe my perception of EDA is incorrect and it's not about that. I've never understood why some people on kaggle do some density charts and no matter what they got they just end up using xgboost.

21-Year Old Tech Entrepreneur claims “I am the World’s First Trillionaire”," 

This is an excerpt from a recent article regarding Chris Kelsey, who claims to be the world's first trillionaire:

Last year you may have heard the news that I would soon become the world’s first trillionaire. I was being modest at the time because I felt I wasn’t ready for the attention. The truth is that I have already been the world’s first trillionaire for a little over a year (and before that I was the youngest billionaire in the world). The $19m Bugatti La Voiture Noire was custom-made as a celebration of me becoming the world’s first trillionaire.

At 21 years old, I am proud to have made these achievements and I look forward to helping change the world in all of the ways I’ve imagined and beyond. Regardless of who is currently running for president, I will officially become president of the USA in 2020. My Bel Air mansion on 822 Sarbonne Road was $88,000,000 — coincidentally 88 symbolizes eternity which is how long I plan to keep this wonderful home. As a side note, my upcoming rap album will be called Eternal Life.

 Bel Air is the richest neighborhood in the world — one because I live here, and two because it just is. In March 2018, I moved into a humble $4.5M Bel Air home paying a bit over $10,000/month on rent. I am thankful to have now achieved my new $88M dream home which will greatly inspire me to keep doing big things. The art hallway will be filled with paintings by Denise (my fiance) and I. The elevator garages will be filled with my dream cars including my Bugatti La Voiture Noire. 

Kelsey Coin allowed me to become the world’s first trillionaire.  I started Kelsey Coin in December 2017 which has now become the only currency in the world. Over the coming months you will find yourself happy to see financial corruption become a thing of the past. There is a total of 1.2 trillion Kelsey Coin and as more people continue to use Kelsey Coin, I will eventually lose my trillionaire title. Considering I have already become the world’s first trillionaire, I am completely content with giving away the title. I see a beautiful future ahead of us and I hope to inspire the world in a way that has never happened before.

"Machine Learning Resume Generator With Python, TextGenRnn and AWS","I was like one of you folks once, trying to think how to write a resume before I started working as a full-stack dev at a place I love. Over the years I have obsessed about how to make it easy for every one to build their resume. Using some AI magic, I ended up creating a site (a side project) that allows you to create a resume for free. Here’s the link: [https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/](https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/)

I've used [https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn) to generate the text by feeding it data scraped from various resources. My script runs in a ""while true"" loop and generates a new resume every 3-4 seconds. Resume is then saved to S3 and the same resume is loaded via CloudFront for all users.

I plan to make it more and more awesome, like you add your name and designation and it fills up your resume. But, I thought it would be nice to get a feedback from you folks and see if I can add the to my to-do for the side project.

I’d the following thoughts on why I started working on it:

\- I knew a guy who got a job at Google, who previously couldn’t get a job at an IT agency just cause his resume wasn’t good enough

\- Not all of us have the skills required to write creatively and organize it. That doesn’t mean you don’t qualify for a job

Things like these are weirdly still a hurdle for many (it is going to be 2020 next year!). I want them not to be a hurdle anymore :slightly\_smiling\_face:

So, pitchfork me if you hate what I built, but if you loved it or have any suggestions do share your thoughts with me. Appreciation will make my day, critique will help me shape it.

You can see different hardware configurations from different vendors.

Prices are starting from 1 cent / hour only !

Depend on project requirements, you can see different options from different alternative vendors. 

You can check these offers on [http://blog.omeryavuz.gen.tr/tag/gpu/](http://blog.omeryavuz.gen.tr/tag/gpu/) 

Also, I am collecting niche content and contribute my ideas on my blog. 

I will some excerpt from my notes, on this platform.

Let me know your ideas to improve my blog as more readable and exciting for readers. "

Anyone know of any (preferably recent) datasets of movie or tv series soundtracks?,"Hi, I’m trying to work on a small data science project as a way to get started on the field, and learn a bit more, and I wanted it to be about tv series (or movie) soundtracks. But I can’t find any datasets out there. There are many with other kinds of info about movies (including a dataset created by IMDb themselves) but not one that has the soundtracks for movies. 

I thought about (and to be honest even started) writing a webscraper to get that from IMDb, but then decided to check their webscraper policies only to find that they don’t allow them at all. So that’s out.

I went back to looking for specific datasets and still nothing. Can I actually find any such dataset out there? Is there a place outside of IMDb where I could gather this kind of data and that allows me to do it “legally”?

"Questions about Data Science in Finance, Economics, and Management Consulting","I recently read [this article](https://www.bain.com/insights/advanced-analytics-global-private-equity-report-2019/) from Bain’s Private Equity practice, and I’m curious if anyone has any experience with this kind of work. (I’m also interested in how this might relate to Bain’s [Macro Trends](https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/macro-trends/) practice.)

&gt;At a time when private equity firms face soaring asset prices and heavy competition for deals, advanced analytics can help them derive the kinds of proprietary insights that give them an essential edge against rivals. These emerging technologies can offer fund managers rapid access to deep information about a target company and its competitive position, significantly improving the firm’s ability to assess opportunities and threats. That improves the firm’s confidence in bidding aggressively for companies it believes in—or walking away from a target with underlying issues.

**Questions:** Does anyone here use their data science skills for private equity research or economics for a consulting firm like Bain? What is that work like? What tools do you use, and how would you recommend someone interested in making a switch to that field? Any recommended resources to learn more about that career path?

**Background:** I currently work as a marketing strategist, I’m starting a dual-degree MBA/MS in Business Analytics in the fall with elementary programming and math experience (though I do have an MA in humanities). Yet I can’t decide if the Data Science or Financial Analytics track would be better for me getting further into my research and strategy career.

I've put a lot of effort into this. Take a look.,"Hi everyone, i'm a a Software Engineering student graduating in Italy and I love Machine Learning.

How many times, trying to approach Machine Learning, you felt baffled, disoriented and without a real ""path"" to follow, to ensure yourself a deep knowledge and the ability to apply it?

This field is crazily exciting, but being rapid and ""new"" at the same time, it can be confusing to understand what each things means, and have a coherent naming of the things across resources and tutorials.

I recently landed my first internship for a Data Science position in a shiny ML startup. My boss asked me if it was possible to create a study path for me and newcomers, and i've put a lot of efforts to share my 4-5 years of walking around the internet and collecting sources, projects, awesome tools, tutorial, links, best practices in the ML field, and organizing them in a awesome and useable way.

You will get your hands dirty and learn in parallel theory and practice (which is the only efffective way to learn).

The frameworks i've chosen is Scikit-Learn for generic ML tasks and TensorFlow for Deep Learning, and I'll update the document weekly.

No prior knowledge is required, just time and will.

Feel free to improve it and share with everyone.

Suggestions for structuring an undergrad DS minor?,"Based on some other comments in this sub today, I thought I'd ask this community: what should go into an undergrad minor in data science at a public US university? What should *not* go into it? Any model programs?

Because of my interest and activity in DS, I've been asked by some colleagues to help with putting together this minor. We're a very small university, but we have several excellent math instructors, a few heavily data-sciencey social scientists (I'm one of them), and a few CS instructors. 

An undergrad minor is an odd thing; it's not a Master's program or even a Bachelor's major degree program. Some people enrolling would be adding ""flavor"" to a math or CS degree; others would be trying to increase their marketability or job value in any of a dozen other fields. A minor, IMO, might aspire to offer something to students that actually increases their employability, or makes their career (whatever it turns out to be) more satisfying. As a minor, very few of these students will go on to be ""data scientists."" Of course, we would love to turn this into a full undergrad major program, someday; but the minor has to work, first.

Right now the program proposal (which was rejected by the curriculum committee, partly because of its merits, partly because someone on the committee has strong opinions about everything) is a mix of lower- and mid-level math courses (including one or two stats courses), a few CS courses, a research methods course, and maybe one ""how to work with data"" course. Naturally I think we should have more in the latter two categories (methods and working with data). However, what do I know? What else should we be doing? Are we looking at this wrong? What considerations do we need to keep sight of?

Interview Rant from Experienced Data Scientist,"Incompetent interviewers are so frustrating. Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks 

""Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.""

Well then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking ""Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about."" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.

He then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.

He then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.

I get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. 

What's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say ""Well at least I don't have to work with him.""

Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks

"About to graduate with no formal experience, would appreciate some advice","Hi everyone, 

I'm about to graduate from UCSD with a B.Sc. is Machine Learning and Neural Computation and I need to figure out fast if I want to do grad school or invest more time in industry. If I choose the grad school route I'll need to take a year or two to get experience in research as an RA or Lab Tech (probably in Computational Neuroscience or Data Science). I can probably get a few letters of Rec from professors and TAs.

Need help on customer purchase prediction and segmentation,"So in this project Im currently working on, I have tracking data for people who in various e-commerce sites. From those data, we are connecting the web id to people who are clicking car ads, and we also have marketing campaigns where the company launch cars and people have to register to attend, so we have personal information and connection with web id. And then, we also have data on people who made the booking for the cars. 

So my first thought of course, being a new data scientist in this area (advertising), to make purchase prediction classification algorithm, and then we can derive features importance and then adjust the marketing campaign based on that. But my marketing manager want me to make customer segmentation, so he want several groups based on how eager they are to buy the car. The thing is, we have target class imbalance data. From around 200 thousands personal information and their web activities we track, those who made the booking is only around 4%. 

With algorithm like random forest and XGboost, I can predict who are most likely to buy the car. But how can I exactly do customer segmentation, dividing into several groups based on eagerness to buy, also to see from each group, what kind of interests they have outside of cars from their web activities on e-commerce sites. How do I combine customer segmentation with prediction? Im looking at several customer segmentation techniques and cases but it seems like most of them are based on data when customers have made several purchases. In my case, majority of the people in the database don't make the purchase, so I dont know how to make clustering algorithm based on that.

Kelsey Coin to become USA Official Currency by end of 2019,"This is an excerpt from a recent article posted by 21-year old self-proclaimed trillionaire tech entrepreneur Chris Kelsey:

Kelsey Coin has already become the world’s only currency. With that being said, the USA is the first country to recognize Kelsey Coin as its official currency. During this process, existing banking systems run by companies such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of America, etc. will shut down.

One of the main concerns regarding Kelsey Coin’s future is system security as we don’t use illegitimate concepts such as blockchain. The truth of the matter is that it won’t matter. There are many different ways to ensure complete account security and we will take all required measures to do so.

Certain government sectors including the Federal Reserve will no longer have a purpose and therefore will be shut down entirely. I am not concerned regarding any potential “lost jobs” because Kelsey Coin will stabilize the economy so that petty work is no longer required. Automation of course will aid this process and we need to stop acting like these jobs are necessary.

It is very likely that a number of other countries will recognize Kelsey Coin as their official currency this year but the USA is the only country I can say for certain as of now. It is important to educate the world on how to use Kelsey Coin and its related platforms (World Home and Black Market World).

A Question About Remote Jobs in Data Science,"Hi Everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the exact right sub for this question--I posted it over in r/jobs as well but I was hoping to get some feedback from people in my field if possible.

I was wondering how much flexibility telecommuting employees have as far as where they work from. For some context, I currently live in New York (In Data Science / Analytics) but my SO may be doing a degree program in England. I don't want to fully give up my NY residence if I don't have to, so I'm looking for remote opportunities which would allow me to work from either the US or the UK. My ideal situation is one where I could spend 2 or 3 months at a time in either country, while working remotely full time. Is this possible? Most Remote Data Science opportunities I've seen say something like ""Work from anywhere in the US"" but I'm not sure if this means you can't work outside the country, or just that you need to be based in the US (citizenship, resident, paying taxes etc). I'm born and raised in the US so that wouldn't be an issue.

I'm not sure how to manage the data flow and if I could choose the stocks ahead of time (to speed up processing) or probably just use filters to get the ones I wanted.

Best if free, will consider if not and is a great source, would like to have access to things like current and past share price to earnings ratio (or simply both the share price and its net earnings), current and past revenue, expenses (to figure profit margin) cash on hand, debt, history of paid dividends...

Providing Business Value to E-commerce Company with Pandas/SQL,"I work for an e-commerce retailer generating millions of dollars online

I've been keeping an eye on their Google Analytics account as well as their paid search account and i've been trying to find some information that senior management would find useful

&amp;#x200B;

Since management mostly talks about  increasing year on year revenue, and reducing costs i've been cutting our sales data into the following segments

&amp;#x200B;

**1. average value of a product category, and average cost of acquisition of a product category** 

Here i'm trying to discover categories that are providing good return on their advertising costs, so we can reduce or eliminate

**2. identifying categories or products that we're not getting people visiting on, even though we have plenty of stock**

Here we can start to steer our marketing department to focus on categories or actual products so that we get more eyeballs to those category or product pages

**3. grouping products by average product value** 

such as chairs ($50) desks ($100) and standing desks ($200) - however this is similar to point #1

&amp;#x200B;

**More advanced analysis recommendations**

This feels like very basic analysis, i'm wondering what other types of analysis you can suggest that will provide solid value to the company? 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the difference between Data Science and Simple Analysis**

I'm doing courses on Pandas and R - however I feel I can already perform this type of analysis with SQL and Excel - where 100,000 rows on a modern Intel 8700k can handle just fine.

**Pandas/R vs Excel/SQL/Regex**

When will Pandas and R start to improve my analysis, recommendations and decision making? It seems that Pandas and R not really adding much to what I already do?

Just got my first job as a Data Scientist - Thank you note to this community,"I was offered a data scientist job at a unicorn fintech firm with an established data sciences team. It was my first interview for a data scientist role and I had to interview with over a dozen people including multiple leaders within the company. Even before I was invited for a face to face interview, I underwent a coding assessment (timed). I usually do not do well in timed challenges as they make me nervous and I can get flustered easily. They rejected me after the assignment (I received the news while I was waiting in the lounge of another company getting ready for my final interviews with the second firm for a Developer role). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But after the rejection, I decided that it wasn't the best assessment of my performance and I took all the feedback the team had for me and re-did the challenge over the course of next week. I reached out to the company again with my results and asked them to reconsider my work (with little expectation). I think the company liked my initiative and they invited me for onsite interviews. I said yes to this since I had another offer for a different role from a startup. My onsite interviews were average at best and shitty at worst. I felt I did not do well and went to bed at 5 in the evening. I could not answer questions from past since most of these questions were from five years ago. During the technical interview, the interviewers were looking for a very specific answer, but I had zero clue on what exactly they were looking for. I felt comfortable defending my work, but that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By next noon, I got the dreaded call from the recruiter and she tells me that they really liked me (very puzzling). They wanted me to do a few more interviews with the team since the team wanted to be sure that I knew my shit. Now, to give you a quick idea about my background, I don't have much data science experience outside of some projects I did while on my free time and my startup which focuses on visual data. So I was pleasantly surprised that the company gave me an offer in like two hours after I finished my final interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

"Scared to take a chance on Data Science (vs Accounting), would it be right for me?","I am currently a fourth year student studying towards a double degree BMath (University of Waterloo) and BBA (WLU) in Canada. So I really value the good mix I get of the communication/collaboration and case based skills I get from the business degree, but I have also been exposed to critical thinking, statistics and cs courses at UW. One thing I learned about myself early on in uni is that I'm actually not great in Math. Probably only statistics because I see its applicability better, but getting down to the theorems, proofs for the pure math classes doesn't interest me nor does it click as easily for me. I've enjoyed learning R, SQL and Python, but I don't have any type of interest to be a developer who knows back-end coding using C++, C#, Java ...etc. 


I was fortunate to have co-op internships at 2 banks and an insurance company, and I have one left to complete this year. I was an IT Business Analyst at one of Canada's big 5 banks, and ngl, it was boring af. Maybe it's because I was a co-op and they gave me the grunt work, but it wasn't enjoyable and a lot of the people I worked with seemed all about themselves and cocky af. I did enjoy working with the Business Intelligence Tool, Tableau, for report building though. My other co-op I was a QA at a bank, and damn that was even more boring. I learned a lot, but didn't enjoy the QA work involving JIRA tickets, solving and testing them in the SIT and UAT environments. Finally, I did a finance/accounting co-op at an insurance firm and enjoyed that the most. The people were friendlier, more analysis, the company value was upbeat and great. But at the end of the day, idk if I'd enjoy the month-end work all the time :/ What I did enjoy though was the project they made the co-ops do where we had to us MS Visio to map out one of the accounting account processes which was really neat and I learned way more from that then the boring month-end tasks I did.


I feel like just settling with Accounting and working towards a CPA because it's a stable career, earnings are decent, and I can grow in the area (side: NOT interested in finance careers involving Capital Markets, equity analyst, IB stuff or actuarial science).  However, I know it's hella boring (based off my last co-op), but if it means financial stability, I'll do it. However, at the same time, I feel like I am doing NOTHING with my Math degree if I take this route, and there's so much more I can do with it as a STEM major. Do you think I should reconsider a different career that utilizes the math degree? A lot of people have told me to consider Data Science, which I am currently researching using this sub but I don't know if I have the skills or competency to make it. I still have 1.5 years of school let, so I am going to try taking more stats or cs courses (any recommendations for other skills to learn would be great).

Therefore, I am trying to come up with a better solution. Now, if the data i am after were available on a webpage, i would simply try to crawl the webpage and scrap the content that i need. 

I am not as familiar with mobile-apps however, so i am uncertain to what extent this is possible/ feasible.   
The best alternative I could come up with so far is to use an Android-Emulator on my pc and use image based text-recognition.

 However, I believe that automating this process (taking pictures, scrolling through the app, ...) might end up being significantly more time intensive than manually copying out the data (and still require manual operation once it's done).   
Any ideas, suggestions and experiences are much appreciated!  


I mostly work with R, and am currently looking to improve in Python, so a solution in either of these languages would be preferred, but I am open to anything, really :)",datascience,1552848635,nihi_,0,1,True,2019-03-17,1,"'Scraping' data from Mobile App Hello everyone,

Value of becoming Certified ScrumMaster,"I'm currently a senior data scientist in a small startup in Boston. I'm looking to change companies in the next year and want to begin getting experience leading a team. My current startup is very small and flat organizationally. I basically own the production machine learning pipeline and don't work closely with other team members on it, so no opportunities to manage juniors, etc.

My goal is to eventually be in a VP/Director of Data Science position and recognize I need experience leading a team. Our engineering group uses Agile (loosely) and believe this is common for many companies.

Given that I am looking to make a job change in the next year, should I pay out of pocket to get the Certified ScrumMaster designation ($1K USD and two days of classes)? Would this be a differentiator when interviewing? I'm thinking it may provide signal that I'm committed to developing as a project manager/leader, and also be valuable in its own right. 

And before this gets raised, yes, I understand that my chief value will be based on my core technical skills as a data scientist. I am already heavily invested there. FWIW, my background is PhD in engineering from a great school, 4 years experience in risk consulting for nuclear/defense industries, 4 years data science/machine learning experience.

Am I setting myself for failure ?,"A lot of students in my class (data science program) are really advanced on some hot subject, neural network for instance, while we had only had one 2-hour introductory class about the subject.

Data scientist without the title ?,"Hello everyone,

RBF Kernel Ridge Regression - linear or not?,"I 'm in a dispute with someone.

"Altair, visualization made less existentially challenging.","A semi rant and recommendation on visualization in Python. I'll be completely honest, I have a secret. I avoid visualizing data in my notebooks as much as humanly possible. Python visualization is not smart. I've tried matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, plotly (I actually like plotly but it has it's few problems too), and other random visualization libraries.

It always happens the same way. 
1) I want to visualize some data. 2) I try to use the library in an intuitive way. 3) get an error. 4) fix the error. 5) spend 20 minutes trying to figure out how to resize something or add a label so I can see what's happening.

By the time I end up making something extremely simple, I've now spent 30+ mins on it. And then I start dreading to even touch the next visualization.
Usually at that point I save my data to csv and do my visualization in Tableau.

I achieve more insight in using Tableau (or any other BI tool) for 5 minutes vs trying to negotiate with Python to make a bar chart that's legible for 2 hours. 

Python, overall, is fantastic for data voodoo, but it has a severe problem in the visualization territory. 

Chartify, by Spotify, attempts to tackle that exact problem, but ends up just +1-ing the list of broken visualization libraries like the xkcd comic.

At this point I've kind accepted my fate with viz, I'll only make a viz in my notebooks if there is an absolute need for it.

how to design experiment with too many variables but not enough samples?,"I want to design an experiment to see which factors affect production quality. Quality can either be a binary response like ""good"" or ""bad"" or a quantitative value like noise level.

There are 10 factors/attributes I'm interested in, and each factor can take on 4 values. Due to cost, I can only make 500 samples of product while varying the attributes in any way I like.

After getting the data, I plan to run a regression to see which factors are significant. I might also try step wise regression or do model selection using F tests. Are these valid approaches?

A few question: 1. Given the number of attributes, which is an ""ideal"" number of samples to get a decent model? Does it matter if the attributes are numeric or categorical (in this case)?

What if the response are multi-class? For example, there might be different failure modes and I'd like to use those as response. Is regression not possible in this case? (I think there are multi-class logistic regression but it's rarely used...)

[ANN] jupyterhub 0.9.4-5 Debian Package,"I released a new version of my Debian packaging for JupyterHub (https://github.com/1and1/debianized-jupyterhub#jupyterhub-debian-packaging). It makes the installation of a fully working hub on a Debian or Ubuntu server easy, with everything already installed and compiled (no build tools needed).

The package comes with a fully equipped Python3 kernel – the scientific Python stack and common visualization frameworks are built in. All additional packages beyond the JupyterHub core are organized into setuptools ‘extras‘. You can select them for inclusion (many are added by default), or remove unneeded ones to reduce the package size, by changing the “debian/rules” file.

On an Ubuntu / Debian workstation, using this package you get readily available notebooks for personal use, without the need to start a notebook server on the command line every time you want to edit a notebook.

Technically, this is a self-contained Python3 venv wrapped into a Debian package (an ""omnibus"" package, all passengers on board). You can build the package in a Docker container, so that you don't need to worry about installing build dependencies – the Dockerfile does that for you, without affecting your workstation or build host.

For more details, check out the GitHub README (see link above).


Changes since 0.9.4-3:

  * Extras: Added 'docker', 'nlp', 'ml', 'utils', and 'vizjs' (included by default)
  * Extras: Added 'arrow', 'nltk', and 'parquet' (optional)

What models are best for Lead Scoring?,"I’m messing around trying to make a lead scoring algorithm for my website based on which pages users visited. The idea is that if they visit pages like customer reviews or detailed product info then they are probably more likely to convert.

The q is what do you guys think is the best DS model to do this? I was going to use logit/probit as this seems quite straightforward. I also thought of using neural networks, but with these, you don’t get coefficients that you can readily interpret i.e. visiting the customer reviews page makes you 2% more likely to convert.

How can I help my company prepare for my departure as a data analyst?,"(Sorry for such a long post; main question is at very end.)

I have finally received an acceptance letter for a Statistics grad program (yay!), and plan on leaving my company in late summer to go back to school full time.  I currently work as a data analyst for an automotive supplier, and my boss is aware that I will be leaving the company, and he will be working with HR soon to start the process of finding (and potentially using me in part to train) a replacement.  Thankfully, everyone is very supportive.

I was the first person in the company, so far as I am aware of, who does ""data analysis"" and has a statistical background, novice as I am on paper in that matter.  I am not very happy with the way my job is currently structured and would have planned on leaving anyway if I had not gotten an acceptance.  My work is not very well defined; there are data management issues (like storage, access, standardization across sites) which slow work; and I do not have anyone in my company who is able to double check my work from a statistical POV—or even more preferably, elevate it to (and appreciate) a higher sophistication.  While officially on a team, I am not on a team of people who do what I do, and am very independent anyway.

I have been asked to help craft a job description for my replacement.  However, while I can easily regurgitate my current responsibilities onto paper and list what skills I have found useful for executing them, I would like to expand this task to communicate back to my employer how best to structure such a job, from hierarchy of needs they should be considering in order to streamline the data analysis process (instead of merely filling roles I have been haphazardly shoehorned into, and ignoring needs which subsume them), to better establishing specific duties to achieve those ends (instead of giving the next person as much autonomy as I have).

I would like to do this, and have come to this community for feedback on how to do so, for two main reasons: (1) I myself need to grow and manage my expectations for what a better data analysis or data science job looks like, and (2) I would like my successor(s) to experience that better if I have some latitude to reform it.

To give a rough outline for what I would like to learn and communicate back to my company, posed as questions:

- **What are the standard vertical and horizontal structures surrounding a technical job like an analyst?**  Right now, I receive work not only directly from my boss, but also often directly from different people in the company (some high up) who are aware of me and the statistical skills I provide.  Sometimes these projects do not have established timelines or well-defined metrics or goals, and this creates disorganization and workload/expectation problems.  After working like this for some time, it seems to me that a wiser system would be for projects to be administered through management, and interactions between groups (such as, a chemical test lab group and my group (myself)) to ultimately start and end from above.  Is this misguided?  How do project management and team interactions work in well-functioning systems?

- With deference to some of the prior considerations, **what sort of environment (have you found) works best for a data analyst to thrive in?**  For instance, I feel that I would have liked to have another person on my team who does what I do so I could bounce ideas off them and assert my own expectations better.  I also feel that the rest of the company isn't very good at managing their own expectations for what a single data analyst can do, and my position as an almost independent service provider within the company speaks to that.  How are data analysis teams organized and how do they manage the request-result cycle?

- **What functions often go underserved in a company starting to sophisticate its data analysis process, and what skills should it seek out to fill those?**  As I mentioned above, there are non-homogeneities in how data is collected and stored and made accessible between different manufacturing or test sites that we have, and some projects that they would want to work on in the foreseeable future will involve more sharing of this data between sites.  Data is often dumped into a ""vault"" specific to each site (with very limited read access), and can be made available in a hodge-podge way on a network we have.  It doesn't seem conducive to accessibility.  I am also woefully underinformed on the full extent of data management at our company, so the problem may just be my level of knowledge; but the prescription nonetheless may be bringing in someone with the skills required to interact with the data we have, even if vaulting and networks are enough.  Who works behind the scenes that a data analyst depends on?  What skills should that person have?

- Finally, **How can I combine the above into job description(s), for employer and prospective employee alike?**  How many people make a good team?  What should they each bring to the table?

These are the things about which I will likely ask more follow up questions.  That may come when I have done some more thorough investigation into what expectations and gaps people in my company find for data analysis.  I also may not be asking the right questions, and I may have different ones depending on the feedback I get here.

Right now though, I think this is my question for this post:

Confusion Matrix giving very confusing results,"I have a training set of binary targets (evenly balanced), 100k records and 600 features. I have a binary classifier that is achieving 50% accuracy on an evenly balanced training set. The 2x2 confusion matrix has 50% of the samples in all 4 quadrants. So the model is having trouble separating the two classes and is essentially guessing. I selected 200 features that seemed particularly relevant out of the 600. After retraining I still get 50% accuracy but now looking at the confusion matrix, the model is nearly always (&gt; 90% of the time) classifying events into the negative class. Now in the total training set, this would actually result in a high accuracy model (98% of examples are negative) but during training I've downsampled the negative class. 

&amp;#x200B;

My intuition is that if the model is having trouble separating the two classes, why is it always guessing one over the other? Why doesn't it randomly predict events into both classes. Just for reference, the matrix looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

.1 .9

.1 .9

which yields \~50% accuracy as the two classes are evenly balanced.

Why is Python pushed so much?,"Hey guys.  


I want to discuss about something that is itching me right now.   


I recently posted in the weekly Entering thread. I am a student in mathematics and computer science who is studying to become a data scientist. I am currently learning C++ by myself and was told to transition to Python ASAP. I was reading a Data Structures and Algorithms book (in C++) during that time (and still am, spoiler!)

&amp;#x200B;

So I did my DD and told myself why not learn that subject in Python to learn the language at the same time? There's where it became more problematic. I understand fully that for someone who wants to become a data scientist, Python is mandatory since it has these beautiful libraries for machine learning &amp; co. But the problem I faced is that when I wanted to implement my own data structures in Python, I realized that so much is done under the hood that it's pretty much impossible to get an in-depth understanding on what is happening, and to optimize stuff on ""my way"".   


So my question goes as follow : Since optimizing is a huge part in a data scientist job, and playing with data structures/optimizing algorithms is also so important, why is it not pushed more to get a core undestanding of it? I understand you can use stuff that you don't understand completely, but for someone who's JOB is to use it, shouldn't he understand at least the fundamentals?   


I want to hear your opinions!  


PS: Just to be sure, I am not ranting on Python, I am saying it's hader to get a grasp on the core because it's all done out of sight. I am not saying C++ is better either, I am asking why people do not recommend to learn a lower level language (any!) before learning Python.

However, I have very good understanding of marketing, strategy and digital marketing in particular, as I helped many brands to become better.

I started with Datastudio, Google Analytics. Was a parrot doing reports and visualisations, but people found it nice. After my documents situation resolved, I could go whatever, but stayed in marketing analysis. Started to do R and a bit of Python, learn Tableau. Learned stats basics required for proper ab test analysis -&gt; distribution, p-value, KS tests and Bootstrap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have an aspiration to move into data science to develop detailed analysis skills and move into predictions/forecasting. Still a long way to go though - full of time/money investments into courses/tutors even to cover basic stats (i.e. k-means, regressions, etc.).

How's my perspective looks like for all of you with fancy PhDs and BS in statistics/maths/research/engineering?

I'm happier with what I do now, but I keep thinking that perhaps I should have just went for a management master or an urban planning master or something like that that was more directly related to my work experience. Looking back, that idea was depressing to me and I wanted something else entirely. But I'm here now, not getting any younger and I've spent all my savings. It gets to me sometimes that I'm broke now while others that were in my Civil Engineering class back in the day are now specialized and prolly got tons of savings. Any advice on what kinda positions I should be applying for?

Many thanks!"
Is this a stupid idea?,"Hey, I recently started getting into all things data and I'm looking for ways I can work independently (for health reasons, and personal too).

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it would be a good idea since I noticed that often smaller companies...

... Do a lot of guess work when making decisions and

... Let a lot of data pass by that could be gathered and put to good use.

THE TRULY ACCIDENTAL DATA ANALYST - IN NEED OF MORE TRAINING MATERIALS,"Hi everyone!!! So I began working with this amazing company almost 1 year ago and was hired on as an Admin Assistant to the Sr. VP and Product Development team. I was asked to create a report in an older version of our Dataself, which I did without any issue. I have been asked for lots of reports to be built and have been very successful in obtaining the information everyone has been looking for. We received some very brief on site training a couple of months ago from Dataself when we upgraded and I was told by the trainer and a developer at Dataself how impressed they are with my reports and what I have taught myself to do thus far. I want to take my training to the next level so that I can build the visual dashboards everyone has been looking and asking for. I would also like to build in Dataself a Dashboard the monstrous report I built from the data I exported out of Dataself and into Excel. 

I am wanting to get all of the certifications I can for myself and for my future. Let me be honest, I am a single mom to 3 kids and I would love nothing more than to prove to them and to myself that I can do and I can achieve anything. 

So my questions for everyone are:
    1. What are the best books to read to learn more?
    2. Are there any actual books that have paper workbooks for me to answer questions and delve deeper into the material than just when I am at work?
     3. What are some of the best YouTube channel videos to learn from?
     4. Should I go back to school and obtain my bachelors degree in this field?

Choosing between MSc Stats and Computer Science,"I was lucky enough to get accepted for MSc programs in Statistics and Computer Science at a T20-Stat and T40-CS university and was hoping I could get some help in deciding between them. I'm posting this as a standalone thread because I think that there is value in hearing about pros/cons of different hard science master's programs.

For me specifically, I have undergrad degrees in Math/Economics and have worked for about two years as an actuary. No formal CS training (but two years of functional experience in VBA/XML), so the CS program will likely take 2&lt;x&lt;3 years. 

The school also offers a Certificate in Data Science, which is something that I'd consider since it is similar in size to a minor.

I have a data set with a lot of categorical variables (100+) which would mean really large one hot-encoding.

Some research into how to build them says you start by making a co-occurrence matrix and then compressing. My question is, does it have to be a co-occurrence matrix, or can the cells contain any information about the variables?

Advice on Career Direction,"Hi all, 

I need a change in my career and looking for some advice on how to successfully pivot.  I've been working mostly as a financial analyst for about 5-6 years now in both private and government organizations. I have an undergraduate degree in applied psychology and a masters in public administration concentration of financial management. Not the greatest credentials but I've made the most of it (suffered from not knowing what I want to do, go figure!). I've always enjoyed dabbling in programming, statistics, and working with large data sets so that's where I ultimately want to end up.  

Problem for me is my degrees don't really help me get my foot in the door for data science/analytics. My professional experience I know Excel well enough (pivots tables, basic vba/macros). Know basic SQL and that's about it. I feel stuck in that I don't have a defined and robust skill set to move upwards. I want to develop one in data science/analytics.  

Naturally I started looking into programs to start building a plan of action and I've narrowed it to 3 options and want to know your thoughts. 

1) self educate using codeacademy and the like. It's cheaper for sure but the big negatives for me on this is I do MUCH better learning in a structured environment and I don't think companies will pay much attention to ""self taught"" data analysts compared to others with certs/degrees.  

2). Data Science Bootcamp through Northwestern/Trilogy. I'm sure most of you know about these. I understand the hesitation for these ""diploma mills"" but I've heard good things about Northwesterns program in particular. This would give me a good understanding of data analysis principles/techniques and allow me to have a certificate which, hopefully, carries some weight coupled with my professional experience in finance. Pros it's 6 months which is shorter than my 3rd option. Access to Northwesterns alumni/career network? Cons, you only get out of it what you put in and it still may not be enough to get me hired in the field?

3) Georgia Tech Online Masters of Data Science. This is an option I kinda like. It's cheaper than any other masters program I've found for online data science. It's freaking Georgia Tech. Cons, time commitment, it'll take 2-3 years and I have to take an intro to python class before applying. This option seems the hardest/longest road but could set me up the best?

Probabilistic Data Structures and Algorithms for Big Data Applications,"I wanted to announce my first book ""**Probabilistic Data Structures and Algorithms for Big Data Applications**"" () to the channel. This is a technical book about popular ""non-classical"" space-efficient data structures and fast algorithms that are extremely useful in modern Big Data applications including data and stream mining tasks. 

It covers the state of the art algorithms and data structures that help to handle such common problems in Big Data processing as *membership querying*, *counting*, *stream mining*, and *similarity estimation*.

* **Membership querying** (Bloom filter, Counting Bloom filter, Quotient filter, Cuckoo filter).
* **Cardinality** (Linear counting, probabilistic counting, LogLog, HyperLogLog, HyperLogLog++).
* **Frequency** (Majority algorithm, Frequent, Count Sketch, Count-Min Sketch).
* **Rank** (Random sampling, q-digest, t-digest).
* **Similarity** (LSH, MinHash, SimHash).

While it is impossible to cover all the existing amazing solutions, this book is to highlight their common ideas and important areas of application. 

The book is available in both E-book and paperback formats. You can get a free preview and all related information about the book at [**https://pdsa.gakhov.com**](https://pdsa.gakhov.com/) or directly at Amazon, of course.

**Boring explanation for people who've never watched**

For the Non-US among us, March Madness is an annual basketball tournament similar to the knockout stages of football (single-elimination) that is used to determine the best college basketball team in the country  (think of it like UEFA Champions league but much more compressed in terms of timeframe). Since college basketball teams play in separate conferences (think domestic leagues), there is no way to claim bragging rights of the best team in the country. It's referred to as madness because the tournament takes place over 2 weeks and anything can happen (like giant-slayers in the FA cup if you're a Brit).

Data Scientist in training - looking for advice on outside of class study topics,"Greetings --

I'm currently taking a bootcamp class where we're spending a few months in an accelerated learning environment and I'm looking for what would be the best things to do outside of normal study.

I'm already going to be working on my Python chops, some extra statistics, and everything machine learning that I can get my hands on.

I guess, is there anything that anyone here would recommend that if they could go back to when they started and focus on when they started?

Thanks!

Topological Data Analysis Project Ideas,I'm a rising senior considering working on an applied statistics project with a professor and I was interested in working on a project on TDA but I don't have the math background to fully understand it. I'm taking a Topology class next quarter but would that be enough to prepare for a TDA project in the fall? I've been programming in R for about a year but I'm not sure if Python would be better for TDA. Does anyone know any resources for an introduction to TDA that is not too math heavy and is more applications focused? I would really appreciate any help or suggestions.

About to hire an entry-level data analyst - What can I do to help support their career growth?,"As the title states, I have been working for a family-run, smaller company for the past [year.](https://year.In) In my previous jobs, I worked for a few Fortune 500 companies where I had Tableau workbooks/BI reports loaded every week for me to review reports to derive business insights and decision-making so I definitely had a good appreciation for data on the front-end. Now that I've joined a smaller company, they do not have much experience other than Google Sheets when it comes to data. Definitely a culture shock for me. 

I know my way around pivot tables and vlookup and could try tying it altogether, but I don't have the capacity/time nor technical skills to become the ""data expert"" in my organization. My role has become more insights / business planning as opposed to analyzing data now so I finally convinced my leaders to hire me an entry level data analyst that will report to me (only because I know how valuable data is and can speak to it, not because I know how to do it)

There is a need right now to provide dashboards, report cards, score cards for insights and data-driven decision making. Also a need for ensuring data being input into the system is correct as well. I plan on ensuring this person ties together our B2B sales with our website sales too. Basically, I want to measure historical KPIs, help with forecasting sales and inventory, as well as social listening so I can identify what's trending in the world using data.

Looking for suggestions for predictive classification models where there's a mix of categorical (ordinal &amp; nominal) and numerical data,"This is technically our homework, but the prof is simply asking for basic summary statistics and I want to go as far as I can to extract value and information from this data. Data is from UCI entitled Dresses\_Attribute\_Sales \[[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dresses\_Attribute\_Sales](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dresses_Attribute_Sales)\]. The gist of the data is that there's 500 entries, and around 13 features. Most of them are categorical, the only one that isn't  is the rating, which is from 1-5. Some categories though have a large amount of factors. At the end column, there's the recommendation (with binary factors) which leads me to believe that either this dress was recommended or not.

Just failed my first data science interview due to not knowing pointless names of things in databases and the technical names of sql functions.,"I would like to point out I'm an accounting major and never took a database management class. 

I work as an analyst for large company and I'm very comfortable in SQL(multi hundred line queries for whatever business needs) and comfortable in tableau. Now you may be thinking this isn't data science at all. But they interviewed me because I work on a good bit of R and Python projects myself and of course my reporting and analyst background. 

The two questions where I failed:

What is a window function in SQL?

What is the difference between a dimension table and a fact table?

I told them I wasn't so sure. I researched what it was and I do window functions every day at work and use dimension tables every day at work !!!! I was unbelievably mad when I read up on this when I didn't know the technical meanings and names of these things despite doing it every day. 

After I reflected on it it makes me think what if companies or people who train junior analysts just use different naming conventions ? What's the differnece of knowing what it means versus knowing how to do it?

Those questions came after I told them about my background in reporting and essentially being in SQL every day and telling them about my personal projects in R and python (R and python are something we don't use at my job at the moment)

Looking back on it I felt like those questions were kind of smug. After those questions they told me thank you and that they would be in touch.

Data Scientists: How often are your insights tweaked by your company due to business reasons?,"Hey all,

So today at work I was compiling the results of an investigation I had done to compare the predictive power of 8 different datasets, putting the score given to each dataset together into a scorecard. This scorecard is going to be presented by our company to a client where we recommend them a dataset to use. However, for two of the datasets I was told to use older versions of their scores, which were worse than the current results, because we didn't want to recommend those 2  datasets, because it would be better for our company's bottom line to recommend one of the other datasets instead.

Hey all,

So today at work I was compiling the results of an investigation I had done to compare the predictive power of 8 different datasets, putting the score given to each dataset together into a scorecard. This scorecard is going to be presented by our company to a client where we recommend them a dataset to use. However, for two of the datasets I was told to use older versions of their scores, which were worse than the current results, because we didn't want to recommend those 2  datasets, because it would be better for our company's bottom line to recommend one of the other datasets instead.

Nokia's Chairman of the Board thinks everyone should learn AI and big data,"""**I can't delegate my learning to others**. If I think AI and big data are so important to being successful, then I should get off my butt, go back to school, and learn about them so I can understand them.""

Those are not the exact words of  Risto Siilasmaa, Chair of Nokia's Board of Directors, but they convey the main message of his interview posted on [lexinexis.com](https://www.lexisnexis.com/communities/lexisnexis_biz/b/bizblog/archive/2019/01/10/nokia-chair-offers-insights-into-artificial-intelligence.aspx)

It's one of the smarter posts about AI I've come across lately. I hope you enjoy.

How important are big data related skills for a data scientist?,"I currently work as a BI developer/consultant. My daily tasks are doing ETL and data pipelines, building OLAP/tabular models and dashboards/reports on top of those models. I like what I do but I want become a Data Scientist in short-mid term, and for that, I've been doing some courses (doing Andrew Ng's Machine Learning from Coursera now). I already have some background in statistics, operational research and quantitative models, from University.
Recently I applied to some companies, and have had some interviews for Data Scientist role, but I was denied in all of them because of my technical skills. And that's why I am doing the courses.
The thing is, I have had a job offer to work as a Big Data Engineer. They offer me some time to learn things like Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, Cloudera, Impala, and others related (I have zero experience on thode).
On one hand, this seems like a good set of skills to have, but on the other hand, I may be deviating from my final objective, by leaning towards the data engineer role instead of data scientist.

Question about my first data science technical interview,"I've recently got through to my first technical stage of a data scientist role.

&amp;#x200B;

The task is to create a deep learning algorithm on a dataset and see how well it predicts gender from a bunch of columns on a feature set of customer data. The catch is the gender is not known or labelled on each customer (simulating how some customers do not fill in personal data and mirroring the need to predict their gender for targetted marketing)

&amp;#x200B;

There are some obvious columns like number of male items purchased and number of female items purchased etc, if the person is a newsletter subscriber, time since last purchase, total revenue, etc. 43 total columns.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, they specifically ask me to use a deep learning method and see how well it predicts, as far as I am aware a neural net needs labelled data to learn and predict so, how should I infer gender? I feel like they are basically asking me to use some clustering algorithm like k-means and then infer gender through the likely split, or break it down into Principal Components and infer gender from there, then calculate a PPV/Sensitivity on 50 bootstraps of a neural net or random forest.

Failed a technical exam (probably) because of graphs.,"A company called, saying since I have no experience I would be place in the same department but my position is called 'monitoring officer'. I relent since I want this job despite the shitty pay. But then there is the technical exam with three problems.

One is a bar graph of employee vs age. The kind of graph you would see in excel. Instruction says to describe the graph. I thought I would get the variance, mean, or other stat related but the space was enough for explanatory sentences. I 'described' it in the end. I  figured hey they didn't ask me to bring a calculator.

Second one is the sales of a corporation in the duration of two months. The mean was given. But the question was is the  mean represented by the sales of each month.

Third one is the same as the first but with a pie chart.

Linearization of my monthly budget how to do it?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - What type of analysis should i use to gauge where my spending is on track or ahead of schedule to be below or surpass my target budget goal?

&amp;#x200B;

i am an Electrical engineer that is a amateur programmer on the side. I also like topics about finance and home automation and look for any excuse to program. Haven't coded much so starting to do more coding for my personal finances.

I have my all my transactions aggregated by a service i pay for, so i have the ability to do whatever analysis i want. So far i have only done basic sums and query function (this is on a google sheet) to give me a summary for a given month on what i am spending based on certain categories. Now i'm interested in doing more data analysis or statistical analysis while doing this using pandas in python to help me learn about both topics. (i know overkill a bit)

**One thing i am trying to do is gauge if I am on track or a little ahead of it on a given spending category. For example, restaurants is a category for any time i eat out, i would like to not only look at how much I have spent so far, how much i budgeted for, and how much that delta is but also would like to see if i am on track or ahead of schedule.** 

With this example so far I have only thought to do it similarly like my company measures our performance to our forecast. (FYI I am also a Product Manager and I work with planning on forecasting for revenue for any given quarter this is only part of my job). The way we track our revenue progress is **percent linearity**. It seems the calculation is pretty simple you just ""linearize"" your **target forecast** to ""hypothetically"" think what if you were to **divide this target by the number of days total in the quarter** (i.e. 90) then that gives you a daily value and if you are on **day 30 of the quarter so 1/3 in you would expect that you would have already 1/3 of your revenue** if you don't then you are below 100% linearity. 

I am not sure if this is the best way to do this analysis but its how my company does it. However for my finances, since i want to learn data science a bit better i want to do this by the book maybe do some typical methodology and try to adopt it for my finances. I have read a lot about **linear regression** but not sure if this is what i should be using.

Any tips/suggestions/advice for a soon to be graduate who is going to start looking for his 1st job in data science/analytics?,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

As the title implies, I'm going to be graduating this upcoming May with a masters in Statistics with a concentration in Data Science. I plan on starting to send job applications in a few weeks in advance in hopes of landing my first salary job in the data science field. 

I am both equally excited for this new chapter in my life, but also quite nervous because I'm not exactly sure what the best method is to prepare for the job interviews or even land a first job, honestly. I don't have any work experience in data science nor did I go to a well-known prestigious school for my BS and MS (SJSU for my BS, CSU East Bay for my MS) so I feel like I'm already at a disadvantage when competing with other applicants. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some odd reason, my school didn't offer any classes in SQL and Python for my grad program so I had to learn those things myself using the online tools available like Codeacademy, etc. As a result, my SQL/Python skills aren't refined and are very much limited. Though, I have a lot of experience working with R, SAS, Excel, even Stata &amp; SPSS, from my schooling.  Because of this, I felt that if I were to try to apply for Data Scientists/Data Analysts Entry level roles, I would have been pretty screwed considering I don't know much SQL and Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why, my initial thought process going forward was to apply for other Entry level roles like Business Analysts and other analytical positions that didn't stress so much on programming like Python. I could very well be wrong on this, which is why I wanted to ask for some clarity if the way I'm thinking is justified?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a plethora of other questions I wanted to ask as well such as:

1) Are cover letters necessary? Do companies even bother looking through those?

2) How should I best prepare for job interviews? What should I study to prepare in general?

3) When's the best time to start applying for jobs? I was told by my adviser that between now-March is the best time.

4) What are the most important traits/skills to succeed in data science? I would like to know so I can know what to polish/learn.

5) Best way to land a 1st data science job without any prior relatable work experience? 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that a lot that I ask is really broad, but I know that there are countless others out there thriving in the world of data science and also some who are also in similar shoes as I am right now so I thought that the best path to succeed is to ask for help. I would really appreciate the guidance!

Though, I have a lot of experience working with R, SAS, Excel, even Stata &amp; SPSS, from my schooling.  Because of this, I felt that if I were to try to apply for Data Scientists/Data Analysts Entry level roles, I would have been pretty screwed considering I don't know much SQL and Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why, my initial thought process going forward was to apply for other Entry level roles like Business Analysts and other analytical positions that didn't stress so much on programming like Python. I could very well be wrong on this, which is why I wanted to ask for some clarity if the way I'm thinking is justified?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a plethora of other questions I wanted to ask as well such as:

1) Are cover letters necessary? Do companies even bother looking through those?

2) How should I best prepare for job interviews? What should I study to prepare in general?

3) When's the best time to start applying for jobs? I was told by my adviser that between now-March is the best time.

4) What are the most important traits/skills to succeed in data science? I would like to know so I can know what to polish/learn.

5) Best way to land a 1st data science job without any prior relatable work experience? 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that a lot that I ask is really broad, but I know that there are countless others out there thriving in the world of data science and also some who are also in similar shoes as I am right now so I thought that the best path to succeed is to ask for help. I would really appreciate the guidance!

Help with an Overview of Data Mining,"Hi, I am currently working on a honours project which focuses on data mining. I have been working mainly with RapidMiner, building predictive models and it has been going well, I quite enjoy it!

Anyway the reason I am writing is, that now I have done some practical work I want to better understand what the term data mining fully entails. So far this is what I have found the term data mining to mean...(Please correct me if I'm wrong with any of this). 

There are 4 groups of data mining techniques, Classification, Clustering, Association Rule Mining and Regression. All of these methods better serve certain situations and have various types of models. (I have some information on what each technique does but I won't include that here, really just after an overview).

I am keen to make sure I'm not missing anything major out, if there are any books or websites that you would recommend on data mining then that would be very helpful too.

Black Swans Meetups: Get to Know Other Data-Scientists!," Hi,

The idea behind *Black Swans Meetups* is that: if data-scientists meet with new data-scientists, they will discover wildly different (often better) approaches, models, etc., which can be applied to whatever they are working on.

Paul Erdős, the most prolific mathematician ever to have lived, recognised this. He was always travelling around, staying with different mathematicians who gave him new ideas to prove new theorems. His motto was “another roof, another proof”.

I imagine each meetup would be held in some capital city, and data-scientists could go to share ideas, give cool presentations about what they’re working on, etc.

Please comment below your thoughts. To learn more, go to: [www.blackswans.io/post/143](https://www.blackswans.io/post/143).

Master degree in Data Science after Bachelor in Physics,"Hello data scientists.

How to go about predicting revenue for the end of the month?,"I'm an MS student specializing in Data Science and an intern at a start up that has a way to predict revenue using a decision tree and it's really inaccurate.

Looking forward to my first offer... As a Golang developer,"Hello data friends! I just wanna check in and share my journey over the last few years. It's atypical, and maybe the outcome would not be ideal for some of you but I think it's just dandy for me.

I graduated in 2014 with a double major in theoretical mathematics and behavioral science. Note, that this left me with no applied math like stats, and deep understanding of calculus and a little topology. I struggled to break into the tech world, and wound up doing a lot of random jobs, from retail to manual labor. 


I discovered data science and machine learning through Andrew Ng's coursera in 2016. I did the Galvanize DSi in early 2017, after about six months of self-study. During the job search, I continued working in a labor field I really enjoy (not going into it here, but it involves music, climbing on steel beams 100+ ft in the air, and a lot of rope). I ended up finding some contracts that supplemented that income well, and enjoyed the variety for a bit over a year. One of those contracts required me to learn Golang for ETL work. The same contract had a few opportunities for interesting mini-projects, but nothing really deep or involving machine learning.


At the end of 2018, I asked my boss at that company what the possibilities were for me in 2019, and he was honest. It'd be more of the same, and he didn't have the time or money to offer me more training to focus on development. So, I resumed my job search.

Since then, I did 51 applications. Four responses, three phone interviews, and then something strange happened. I had gotten to the in-person interview at a major organization, and the Golang experience on my resume caught their attention. I was forwarded to an engineering division, did a phone interview, code interview, then finally flew out this week for in-person interviews. No immediate offer, but I was told to ""start packing"" by their director of engineering as I left the building. 

My title and pay will be as a mid-level engineer, but they're hoping I can act as their liaison between engineering and data science and I am BEYOND stoked for the challenge.

Help with project ideas for my data set?,"Hey all, I also posted this in the weekly sticky, but I'm hoping that it's also ok to post here for more visibility? I'm currently enrolled in a DS bootcamp and looking for ideas for my first Capstone project. I have a data set that I'd really like to use, but I'm not sure what the best thing to do with it would be. I would love some input from you all!

The data set is 3 years ('16-'18) of test results for the New York State mathematics exam for grades 3-8 (found here: https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php).

The files have all elementary and middles schools of every county in NYS, with student performance on the exam (aggregated by grade level). Student performance is measured in Levels, 1-4.

Even though individual student results aren't included, I think this data set is really interesting and would love to use it for my project. My initial thought is to do some sort of regression analysis to predict a particular school's or district's performance in future years, but I don't know if 3 years of data is enough for this. Data sets dating back from 2006 also exist, but don't break down to individual counties/schools like 16-18 do.

Anyone have any thoughts on what else I might be able to do??? Appreciate the help!",datascience,1549759140,seoulmeister,0,1,True,2019-02-09,1,"Help with project ideas for my data set?

Analysis Methods for Firm Leadership using Product Catalogs,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a senior economics student working as a research assistant as part of my final seminar course. The data I have been tasked with assisting in the analysis of involves a series of product catalogs collected by the professor from 1980-2002 called *Data Sources: Hardware Data Communications.* The data in these catalogs is primarily qualitative with each catalog listing computer firms and their products, with each product associated with a list of technical characteristics (such as the processor type, write speeds, memory, price, servicing availability, etc...). One of the goals of the project is to analyze firm leadership across time through the lens of product innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

While much of the data is yet to be compiled into a somewhat usable format (such as an excel spreadsheet),  I am currently looking to determine some potential methods for analysis. 

&amp;#x200B;

An example of my current thought process is to, for each product catalog and subcategory of products find the most common product feature (for example, processor A)  and then backtrack over time to see the first instance of that product feature (for example, Apple was the first to introduce processor A in 1980, and it has now become industry standard in 1982). This may provide some indication of firm leadership, especially if a firm/firms are shown to consistently introduce leading features before their competitors.  However, I am aware that this is a bit of a naive idea of how to think about the problem and am looking to find some more formal analysis methods.

&amp;#x200B;

What methods of analysis should I look to research so as to gain a better understanding of how these types of problems are approached?

There's also code for a web-app I built using flask, but I had no idea what I was doing there and am definitely not looking at jobs now that will require anything like that).

So do people agree that for getting interviews for a second job (hopefully senior DS position), showing off side projects is less important than actual experience?  Or will I get dinged for not having a link to actual code I've written?"

Causal inference in AB tests where customers have not responded to offer,"Suppose customers have been randomized to one of two arms in an AB test designed to assess the lift in spend via some offer.  The goal is to estimate the causal effect of the offer on customer spend.

A non-negligible portion of customers in both arms do not respond to the offer (i.e. they do not spend during the offer period so their recorded spend is NA).  How are these individuals included in the analysis?

My gut says they should be included because if the Intention to Treat Principle, and since they didn't shop they have technically spent $0.  However, this means I would have to fit a hurdle model to the data in order to make inference, right?

Obviously removing these customers will impart bias on the estimates, but does leaving them in the analysis also bias estimates?

Recommend any software to enter data of valid combinations of a highly customization product?,"I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a way to help visualize my data problem. I have a product that can be customized to a high degree. however certain choices aren't compatible with other choices. So I wanted to first of all enter the data in some sort of interface and then from that generate a set of rules from it. 

Let's say the product is a kettle that can come in 10 colours. It also has 5 different options for handles, but maybe one handle doesn't come in one of the listed colours so that's an illegal combination.  The kettle also has different power button styles. But some of those buttons don't fit certain handles. It also has different power chords, but they're not all compatible with certain handles etc etc. You get the idea.

I started to use free online mind-mapping software to draw connections between all the various bits but can't do much with that visual. Is there any software that you can recommend for my purpose? One that will allow me to generate rules that I could use in some custom software to allow only valid variants of the kettle? A nice GUI like mind mapping software would be great. 

I'm imagining a whole bunch of IF statements that can be generated but clearly I don't want to have to write them all out. Especially because there are about 20 of these 'kettles'.

How to filter this data to get a heartbeat signal?,"I am giving my first steps in data analysis, gathering/cleaning.

To learn, I am trying to create a simple code that can detect heartbeats from color variations from the image coming from the camera on the iPhone.

This is what I have done so far:

I have created a code that detects faces and cuts them from the image.
then I get the average color from that face image.

Because the values are grabbed at irregular time intervals, I interpolate the data. Now I have a series of values ""taken"" at regular intervals.

Plotting the data I have [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bFfGu.png)

I think I am seeing something that looks like heartbeats there.

To confirm that I am not seeing artifacts from the camera, I sample a rectangle from the background and I get the same color with very little random variation. The background color is stable and shows barely any variation.

Now, I apply a Direct Cosine Transform to the data and get [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMg17.png)

The DCT has negative vales.

The two first items of the DCT are peaks, at t=0 and t=0.10482311 seconds.

I read a paper where the researcher says heartbeats occur between 0.4 and 4Hz. I suppose this has a relation why the first two DCT items are peaks...

What do I do now?

I have tried to apply a threshold to zero every term from the DCT below 150 and do an inverse DCT to reconstruct the signal and got [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iAOcF.png).

A threshold of 85 gives me [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3ljx.png)

I am not sure if I see a heartbeat there. I mean, the peaks where the beats start.

This is the data at regular time intervals I have (256 samples):

I have tried to apply a threshold to zero every term from the DCT below 150 and do an inverse DCT to reconstruct the signal and got [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iAOcF.png).

A threshold of 85 gives me [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3ljx.png)

I am not sure if I see a heartbeat there. I mean, the peaks where the beats start.

This is the data at regular time intervals I have (256 samples):

"SWE vs. Data Scientist, if I want to work on robotics","I've always had this perception that since I eventually want to work on AI as it applies to robotics, the ideal job title to pursue is Data Scientist. However, I'm afraid I'm going to get stuck forecasting business metrics or something rather than, say, working on self-driving cars or virtual assistants. So I'm wondering if getting a job as a software engineer would be a more logical stepping-stone towards that goal, because at least the way I perceive a SWE's role, it's less ""business"" and more programming than what I think of when I visualize a Data Scientist. But alternatively, I'm worried I won't get to work with ML, NLP, computer vision etc. as a SWE rather than a Data Scientist, and this will hurt me years down the road when I apply to work on Telsa software or something. In summary, in the short term I'd rather focus on programming than business intelligence and getting cozy with the C-suite, but more importantly I also want to make sure my work will count as relevant experience with AI so I can eventually get a position focusing on robotics.

[Q] Why do data science jobs have an MSc or PHD as a requirement? Even if you have all the skills and experience - you are still met with rejection!,"I have created this post because i would like to know what others think of the job situation and can give me some advice on what the hell is going on out there! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at many data science roles in the past few weeks as i am looking to further my career outside of the uk government - however i have been quite angry to find that most or if not a very large proportion of jobs online for mid level and even junior data science positions are requiring a Msc or PHD as a minimum requirement for the job role! 

&amp;#x200B;

Why does a MSc or PHD matter in this field as a requirement? It makes no sense at all - i've met people without those two, and have developed some really great pieces of work and packages in python and R - even they have been rejected from jobs because they don't have this MSc or PHD! So what the hell is going on! why do they even want it???

&amp;#x200B;

anyone else finding this common theme with job ads? mostly in the UK!

I have a bsc in mathematics and have been working as a data scientist for the past 2 years int he public sector - i have the skills and experience for these roles - but  i cannot past the minimum requirement being a phd or msc - so its like an automatic block - this is regardless of how well my kaggle profile is and how good my github projects are (they don't even look at them!)

What are some less traditional Data Science deliverables?,"I have found that in my company, it's hard to come up with the traditional data science/machine learning solutions for the tasks at hand.

[HIRING] Operations Improvement Analyst - Washington Region,"Hi All,

Hopefully don't want to spam too much here, but basically Im the hiring manager and we are expanding our team out into the USA. We are facing new challenges and demands in the scope of our supply chain. In order to remain competitive, conventional methods and processes need to be reconsidered aiming to reduce lead time, increase productivity and subsequently customer satisfaction. The use of enhanced simulation / data &amp; analysis tools is one of the key elements in this context.

You will be part of the team that drives the industrialization and continued development of the supply chain processes to ensure the long term stability and availability. 

As an operations improvement analyst you will be required to work across the complete end to end supply chain. Working alongside the operational teams to support them diagnose, extract insights, troubleshoot and improve the processes and value for the customer.

The team is spread across the globe, matching our operational footprint. It means working in small, multi-disciplinary teams with a focus and responsibility on delivering pragmatic solutions directly to the teams.

**Tasks &amp; Accountabilities**

* You will conduct in-depth analyses (e.g. value stream mapping) to identify improvement opportunities. Understanding business processes and pain points, to gather requirements, opportunities and value levers regarding data and possible use of technologies for process automation
* Provide accurate and insightful data analyses for different operational teams and explain and interpret your findings
* You will take part in complex projects involving several departments within the organization
* You will proactively come up and develop solutions to improve performance within the supply chain environment based on advanced analytics and findings
* Acts as a coach to the functional teams

**Required Skills**

* Practical experience in lean, industrial, process development/improvement
* You have robust coding abilities (Python, SQL, Java) &amp; experience in algorithms, data structures would be a plus
* Experience in data extraction, manipulation and reporting 
* You understand the combination of data analytics and business processes with an appetence for business/industrial problem solving
* Ability to convince in a complex environment (to drive/help decision making across departments)
* You are a quick learner, passionate about your work and driven to get things done with a collaborative way of working
* Hands-on, pragmatic approach to building digital products (hacker / entrepreneurial mindset)

**Summary**

If I had to summarize basically its a nice mix of process improvement &amp; data analytics (significant amounts of the supply chain work we do are within SAP so there's an obvious overlap / synergy) The complete team all work in python and are very focused on real world supply chain problems. If it sounds something that's interesting please feel free to DM me for more info or have a look here at the opening.

I accepted a position about a month ago at a notable data science, analytics, and management company that is your typical run of the mill “big data” tech startup you hear so much about. 

I’m the only person in my cohort of coworkers who ISN’T a computer science major. My coworkers are all graduates from big engineering schools, many of them are recent undergrad graduates as well.

And this was demonstrated recently at a meeting on a large dataset we were tasked with analyzing. I can’t give too much information, as we sign NDAs, but issues arose over what model we would apply. I worked with a similar dataset in my grad school days, and it seemed to me that a simple logistical regression model would suffice to explain the trends. 

Before I could give my reasoning for this, my CS coworkers interrupt me and say “Well, that’s too *simple* of an explanation, I say we try this deep machine learning neural algorithm to test out first.” I exaggerate of course, it was a convoluted model that would be superfluous for such a large dataset.  I voiced my concerns and defended my model, but was scoffed and laughed at by my coworkers. They were joking about my Econ background, “how did you even get to work at this tech company.” Their banter was, expected, as I’ve noticed that’s how their personality is. But it still stung. 

Later on, a close friend of mine overheard the boys talking about my being transgendered and absolutely mocked me behind my back.

1. Do all Data Consultancies use the cloud or do some use private servers for added security?
2. What security measures are available in the Google Cloud Platform specifically?
3. What security measures are available with in Private servers?
4. Any other security measures that may be important when a client trusts you with their data.

Best practice for applying a data science project/codebase to different datasets?,"Hi all -

I'm setting up a data science project/codebase that will need to be applied to different datasets/in slightly different contexts, with a modular and customisable approach. For the sake of discussion, let's assume I want to build code, notebooks and analysis for data coming from 3 countries: `uk`, `us` and `jp`.

I'm using a structure similar to [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

A few questions on best practices:

- Should I create a separate folder in the different codebase areas (`data`, `references`, etc) for each case? i.e. `data/uk/raw`, `data/jp/raw`? Or `data/raw/us`, `data/raw/uk`?
- How should I think about code modularity? Should my notebooks and scripts include a general `country` variable at the top and then run everything using this? So preset to `country=""uk""`?

What do you when people keeps asking to add more data to your model?,"Hey Fellow data scientists, I am sure you know this: it could be your client, your boss, your colleague. They ask for more. ""Can we try adding another year's data?"" ""Could you check if weather makes a difference?""

There is nothing wrong in asking, but they do not know that adding more data is not like a click away. Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it could take days. So what would you do?

As I jot down the problem, I thought of a fews things we can do, so my 2 cents here:

1. make your model more flexible; anticipate the additional ask
2. be smart about how you share the results: if you know they will ask for more however comprehensive your model is, release in phases
3. clarify the objective: what do you want to prove? what is the hypothesis? how does adding additional data help?

When Should You Do Pre-Processing to Avoid Over Fitting?," 

When should you do pre-processing to avoid over fitting?

Do you do it both on the training and the test set, which may give you different values. Or do you apply the same values from the training set to the test set, which may lead to over-fitting.

I am confused by this quote below. For example, if you use mode imputation for a class on the training set, should you use mode imputation on the class for the test set, even if you get a different mode? Also, if you use mean imputation for numerical data in the training set, should you also use mean imputation on the test set (meaning you will have a different mean value than the training set)?

""To provide a solid methodology, one should constrain themselves to developing the list of preprocessing techniques, estimate them only in the presence of the training data points, and then apply the techniques to future data (including the test set).""

Manager asking me to make my own job responsibilities (Entry Level),"I've been working at a new job with a probation period of three months.

Are 'live' Technical Screens the Norm?,"This is half rant, half question - as /r/datascience is about the only place with people who I can vent to about this kind of stuff. 

So I'm currently working as a DS for the federal government. The way I ended up here was sort of a strange path but in short there was no real interview, I was doing the work, involved other DS in the organization despite not having that title - and when the title did come available, those who were hiring were already intimately familiar with my skill set so the interview was a bit of a formality. To be fair, this has been the case for much of the last decade, I have let my reputation and work stand for itself and thus never really had interviews. 

Now I find myself potentially having to transition out of this role and switching to a new field completely (where I have no reputation), and have been interviewing with a number of DS roles in the private sector. 

I just had a technical screen for large financial institution, which remarkably was the 3rd of 4 interview steps. The format was in google docs and on the phone, 2 technical leads pasted a problem/puzzle and asked me to code a solution in the language of my choice - in front of them - on a blank google word doc. And I froze up. Literally, I turned into a bunch of 'ummmm, well, ummmm's, very very embarrassing. After a few excruciating minutes, I basically asked if I could just fuck of and do it on my own in jupyter notebook, they said sure all good. 

The allotted time I had was 1hr and I came up with a really nice clean and efficient solution on my own in about 30 minutes and returned it to them.  Honestly, the solution made me say 'fuck yea, thats nice' to myself - but I feel that it may fall on deaf ears due to my first round of performance anxiety. 

So to wade through my post above it comes down to this:

**TLDR;** I am not a script kid, I dont even really consider myself a coder. I'm 'good' at a few languages, but I don't peg myself as fluent beyond the basics (create a dataframe, write an if statement, write a while loop, etc..), but is this on the spot, ""write code for me now monkey"" coding challenge going to be something that is the norm for the industry - or will it be more of a 'you have x amount of time to solve this and submit' type ordeal.

I'm 'good' at a few languages, but I don't peg myself as fluent beyond the basics (create a dataframe, write an if statement, write a while loop, etc..), but is this on the spot, ""write code for me now monkey"" coding challenge going to be something that is the norm for the industry - or will it be more of a 'you have x amount of time to solve this and submit' type ordeal. Because if the later, I think I'll be ok, if the former, I may need a lot more practice. "

RFM Segmentation,"Wondering if anyone can provide some insight here on RFM segmentation and how to deal with large swathes of low frequency customers.

I’m currently developing customer segmentation for my customers, using the RFM model. I’m splitting into 5 percentiles per metric and the recency and monetary metrics behave exactly as expected, with a very even spread across the percentiles.
However, as I have a lot of customers who have a frequency of 1 (around 45% of all customers), my lowest two percentiles are practically identical, with the top percentile having the largest range (10 - 700+). 
I understand this is how percentiles work - they spread everything evenly, but the frequencies themselves don’t seem even. 

As this is my first time using the RFM model, I’m wondering if this is normal, or if there is a way people have dealt with these types before. 
I have tried removing these 1 frequency customers from my percentiles and then giving them their own segment after the fact (providing they don’t fit any of my other segments of course) and this helped somewhat, but want to see if I’m doing the right thing here.

Tips for someone with non-typical experience?,"So I have been applying to data analyst/junior data scientist positions for the past few months with no luck at all.

Best way for a noob to create an analytics site?,"I just landed a new job at a company working with the analytics team (not necessarily working on machine learning related projects), but I am using Python and R on a few things. I've noticed that when it comes to \*reporting\* analytics, we are using a relatively antiquated way of going about things. We're relying on Excel spreadsheets to present information for the most part where the data comes from Business Objects. This existing system is convenient in some ways but probably more limiting, I'd argue:

MapReduce vs Deep Learning,"I see in 2017 that hortonworks had a lot of change that supports more of tensorflow, so on and so forth (I'm a noob).

When I am done in a year, I will need to read a dover book to refresh. Other courses are a lot of math, data structures, C++, and advanced C.

CNN's and RNN's seem interesting but I dont know if my time is optimized by learning ""AI"" by myself, or if Nueral networks are are even dependent on Map Reduce infrastructures..

Need help using multivariate time series or other supervised methods to predict a continuous future outcome with two date attributes,"So I am working on getting a revenue forecast / prediction off the ground at work but I’m having trouble with one aspect of it: handling two date attributes that both add meaningful information.

To add some context the ideal outcome is to predict / forecast revenue as accurately as possible. Assume revenue is being committed for a future date (think airlines or hotel rooms), and that there are constraints to be accounted for with overall occupancy (limited supply of spaces to be filled, again think airlines or hotels).

The problem is that I could just use university or multivariate time series and/or other supervised methods to accomplish this, but they leave out the context of the rate at which revenue is being committed, of which there are both recent trends that are relevant as well as seasonal trends.

When compiling this in the data this leads me to an impasse where I’m not certain exactly how to proceed.

 There are two date parameters - the “stay date” or “flight date” (I.e. the day for which you are committing revenue) and there are “effective dates” between now and they “stay date” which are used to quantify the rate of committed revenue against a given stay date.

In this situation is it better to try to retain a multivariate time series method to preserve the function of forecasting out to a set horizon by adding attributes that capture “rate of committed revenue” and “days out from stay date”, or would it be more advantageous to iteratively predict one “stay date” or “stay period” at a time considering the full set of effective dates at which the additional pickup in revenue is measured?

Additionally are there methods that can do both?

Help framing a problem for Bayesian Modeling with PyMC3,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a chemical engineer with an interest in data science, particularly in Bayesian Modeling after reading [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) which I highly recommend.  I'm not a very experienced data scientist, or python programmer for that matter, so while the motivating examples were really interesting, I'm having a hard time translating this in to workable problems to practice with in my daily life.

&amp;#x200B;

I came across a problem recently at work which I think fits the bill, but I'm not really sure how to approach it.  The context is as follows. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a batch process that yields a bunch of drums of a material.  The material has some property (turbidity) which can range from say, 0-1000, and should be the same for each drum in the batch.  The drums are then consumed to produce the final packaged product, where turbidity is measured.  For a number of (bad) reasons, the drums are chosen randomly, so you can have several drums from different batches which contribute to the final measurement.  What I have thanks to the QC people is a list of turbidity measurements for final product and a detailed list of the drums which went in to each one.  So a data point might be Turbidity = 100, which was made with 1 drum from batch 3, 1 drum from batch 6 and two drums from batch 8.  And I've got a couple dozen of these.  Safe to assume that the measured turbidity is a simple average of the drums that went in.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is to calculate posterior distributions of the turbidity for each batch based on the observed final product measurements.  

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I created a model with a uniform prior for each batch, and used the turbidity measurements as observed data, but I'm not sure that's quite right.  In the example above, I would create another uniform distribution for say, batch 8, and set observed to \[100,100\].  But this ignores the contributions of the other batches.  This gives results which are broadly consistent with frequentist thinking, where the priors quickly converge to the average of the each measurement the batch was involved in, but qualitatively I feel like it's really underestimating the uncertainty given the way the data is generated and the small data sets.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to start modeling this?  Thanks!",datascience,1550361726,Projob2014,2,1,True,2019-02-16,1,"Help framing a problem for Bayesian Modeling with PyMC3 Hi All,

We have a batch process that yields a bunch of drums of a material.  The material has some property (turbidity) which can range from say, 0-1000, and should be the same for each drum in the batch.  The drums are then consumed to produce the final packaged product, where turbidity is measured.  For a number of (bad) reasons, the drums are chosen randomly, so you can have several drums from different batches which contribute to the final measurement.  What I have thanks to the QC people is a list of turbidity measurements for final product and a detailed list of the drums which went in to each one.  So a data point might be Turbidity = 100, which was made with 1 drum from batch 3, 1 drum from batch 6 and two drums from batch 8.  And I've got a couple dozen of these.  Safe to assume that the measured turbidity is a simple average of the drums that went in.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is to calculate posterior distributions of the turbidity for each batch based on the observed final product measurements.  

&amp;#x200B;

Initially I created a model with a uniform prior for each batch, and used the turbidity measurements as observed data, but I'm not sure that's quite right.  In the example above, I would create another uniform distribution for say, batch 8, and set observed to \[100,100\].  But this ignores the contributions of the other batches.  This gives results which are broadly consistent with frequentist thinking, where the priors quickly converge to the average of the each measurement the batch was involved in, but qualitatively I feel like it's really underestimating the uncertainty given the way the data is generated and the small data sets.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to start modeling this?  Thanks!"

How to properly apply bounce back effect (a future correction) to a prediction model,"Hi Ive developed a model for some predictions, and I found that it works bests with variable ""X"" as the best and highest weighted predictive variable. But there is only one issue I dont have clear how to solve, and that is future corrections. 

See, ive found an average of 94% correlation of the true statistics with the main variable after a sample of 46 (thats the most I can get in a single sample). And although the inmense majority of samples have a 90%+ correlation, there are a few outliers, and the biggest one was just 74% correlation at that point. 


So in adjusting for future corrections, should I take into account the average correlation up to that point? Or should I take the mininum correlation as to not miss anyone? 

Note: not taking into account corrections has proven way worse in mi predictions that do taking them (I only take them with the lowest correlation though).

Support vector Machines conceptual question: Minimum memory needed to store parameters for linear and non-linear kernels?,"I saw a question asking what is the minimum possible memory needed to store parameters for a SVM classification model that outputs a boolean variable (so a binary classifier), where each data-point has N features. 

I am guessing the minimum memory will correspond to simply the number of weight parameters that are trained/stored in the SVM model and used for predictions. I understand the dimensions of the weight parameters will differ based on what kind of kernel is being used. Here is what I think is the answer to the questions is for different models:

  
Linear kernel- the minimum memory needed here should be for storing (N+2) weight parameters, similar to that of a linear regression model (N parameters for N features + 1 intercept parameter) + 1 regularizer (C) parameter

&amp;#x200B;

RBF/Gaussian kernel- the minimum memory needed here should be for storing (N+3) weight parameters: N weights for N features, 1 intercept parameter, 1 regularizer parameter, and 1 gamma parameter that decides the spread of Gaussian distribution

Complex- non-linear Kernel:   
For a kernel with a decision boundary like this ([https://imgur.com/NM6NFgS](https://imgur.com/NM6NFgS)) I am guessing the minimum number of weight parameters would be &gt;2N+1,  and depend on how complex of a kernel I am creating.

What foundational steps should I learn in order to become a data scientist.,"I already know SQL and Tableau very well and a little bit of R, however I am well aware that is just scratching the surface with R.

Approach to forecasting multiple related products,"Hi, I'm fairly new into my first Data Science role where my work thus far has been building a price sensitivity model (Python, mostly).

Analyzing my weight loss journey with machine learning,"Hi r/datascience!

I would like to share my personal data science project on how I analyzed my weight loss data in 2018. You can read my [writeup](https://link.medium.com/9KJRGuzsqU) on the project on Medium, and check out its Github [repo](https://github.com/dknguyengit/logweight).

The 2 main goals for the project are:

* Build a machine learning model (namely regularized logistic regression) to classify whether I would gain weight or lose weight on a given date. The parameters of the model (the regression coefficients and the decision boundary) are also used to give simple, actionable numbers that I could use for my weight loss journey.

* Build this machine learning model from scratch without using 3rd-party libraries (aside from numpy and pandas). This includes the model algorithm (batch gradient ascent), k-fold cross validation, performance metrics, ROC curve, and other related visualizations.

I've tried to tailor my writing to be accessible to beginners (as I'm also a relative beginner to data science). Therefore, I'd truly appreciate any input on how I can make my writing and visualizations better.

Also, I'm planning to do a 30-day challenge, during which I followed the guideline outlined in the project, and see how consistent I can lose weight doing so (perhaps via daily updates through a Twitter account). I think it might be fun to use this as a real-life test set for my model, but I'm afraid of the potential public failure. If you've read my Medium post, please let me know what you think about this idea.

Help with coding exercise,"Dear r/datascience,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a beginner in the data science domain, and I am starting to apply to related jobs.  I have a PhD in Computer Science, but since I focused on more theoretical topics related to Knowledge Engineering, I only recently (2 months) started learning topics such as Python programming and Machine Learning. I know I do not have much hope in getting a job right now, but I am looking for challenges and opportunities to learn.

I come to you asking for insights on how to proceed with a coding exercise I was given. It is an open ended one, and I am supposed to improve the internal site search of the company I am applying to. The output can be a visualization, a predictive model, a framework of a data product. I was provided with a sample of data from the following business areas/dimensions:

1. Products: a CSV containing data such as id of the object searched, its name, a description, category, etc...,
2. Queries: a CSV containing example of queries with timestamp, session id, user\_id, and the query (a simple string).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am kind of stumped on how to approach this exercise, since it is very much open-ended. My guess is that I should create some programs for a user to do queries that can exploit the richness of the product file info, so I am guessing that I will need to do some trials with scikit-learns to develop some machine learning models to maybe predict the behavior of a user that searches certain types of products or a query engine that can discriminate similar objects via filtering. Does any of these ideas make sense and are related to data science or am I missing something due to my novice status? Notice that I am not expecting somebody to do this for me, I am taking this as a learning opportunity to try with a real life dataset to build something  and exercise.

For context, we support a call center, and have short and long-term forecasts that help us adequately staff and prepare our budgets.

[META] Seeking input on subreddit rule (and style) changes,"As we have mentioned previously, **the primary purpose of having a Data Science subreddit is to provide a place for DS professionals to discuss and debate topics relating to the field/industry.**

Unfortunately, due to the high interest in data science from those currently outside the field, the subreddit is frequently inundated with submissions that do not fit the above purpose and are generally very repetitive.

Previous actions have been considered and taken by the mod team to rectify this issue.  Almost a year ago, we proposed a rule requiring submissions to either be made by a user with flair or be approved by a moderator.  Due to objections and suggestions from the community, we instead introduced a weekly sticky thread to capture these kinds of posts rather than have them appear in the subreddit.

However, this has not been as successful as hoped.  Thus, the mod team has discussed additional changes that we would like to implement.  Our new plan is twofold: 

1. Make significant changes to the submissions page, sidebar, and automoderator of the subreddit to help instruct new/unfamiliar users about the weekly sticky thread and rules in general.

2. Enforce the policy by enacting a short-term ""submission ban"" on users who make improper submissions.  Bans would not prevent users from posting in an existing submission (like the weekly sticky).

How to compare and pick models?,"I'm doing a project for my Machine Learning course in my university which consists on training five different models (linear and non-linear) for a given classification or regression problem, pick the best and reason about its performance etc.

What technique do you guys use? Do you have any advice? 

PS: first time posting, not an expert or anything but I like the field of machine learning and been reading for some time :)"

Biological knowledge graph project seeking collaborators,"Hi all,

I'm part of a project that's been working on automatically generating knowledge models from scientific text. The purpose is to cast information from scientific papers in a form that allows us to query that information in much deeper ways than current search allows. This is not a new idea from a research perspective, but practical solutions in the space seem few and far between, and our tech has had some promising early results.

I'm eager to chat with anyone who might be interested in any aspect of the work itself, or the emerging opportunities.

Last year of undergraduate in mech. eng. and interested in pursuing a career in DS and ML. Do the contents of these courses in data mining and spatial modeling for geomatics applications sound like a good start?,"First of all, I apologize for my petty and nooby question. I know the sub is currently under a state of discussion and normally I would post in the questions thread but since its unstickied I feel not many people will see it so I will try my luck while the career questions issue is solved.

&amp;#x200B;

Next week I have to select my classes for next semester. I am considering taking a master degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and doing a thesis on applications of machine/deep learning but right now I still have one more semester to go before that. I found two classes in the Geomatics department which indeed sound like ""data science"" and ""machine learning"" will be involved but since I know some of these are buzzwords which are thrown around randomly in the past few years I want to ask you, r/datascience , if the contents are indeed useful for putting me in the right track towards building a DS career even if I'm not particularly interested in geomatics. Below are the contents which are supposed to be covered in these two classes.

"Recent college grad with some time to learn DS on the side. Which learning path should I go with? Also, should I continue learning R or should I switch to Python?","Hi everyone, 

I recently graduated college and have been working as a data analyst at a very large corporation for about 5 months. Although I love my employer, my role isn't particularly interesting so I've been thinking about what to study on the side to eventually advance into a data science role within the company in the future. 

I used R a lot in my undergrad classes as well as research in engeering that I did, but I am far from perfect in it. I've been seeing a lot that Python is a hot commodity and was wondering if I should continue with R or switch over to Python? 

I don't anticipate looking for a new job in the next few years so I definitely have some time to learn. I want to learn the nuances of the language I'm studying, brush up on my statistics, increase my knowledge on machine learning, and then look at big data analysis with Spark. Here are some paths I was thinking about:



#Python:

1. MIT Intro to CS edx course to learn the foundations

2. Python for Data Analysis book

3. Brush up on stats

4. Hands on Machine Learning book

5. Learn Spark book



#R:

All books

1. R for Data Science

2. Advanced R

3. Intro to Statistics and Data Analysis

4. Into to statistical Learning

5. Deep Learning with R

6. Big Data Analytics with R



I was also looking at Dataquest and was extremely intrigued by their curriculum. Can anyone vouch for them? 

Datacamp didn't seem as much my thing but I'd love to hear opinions on it as well. 

Also if anyone can share their learning path that would be great! Maybe some Coursera or edx courses?

OK to ask what kinds of technical questions to prepare for on-site interview?,"I had a phone screen with a small company recently. The position will involve data analysis, machine learning, and OOP. I was not asked any technical questions about ML, OOP, or anything technical at all actually during the phone screen, not even any technical questions about stuff on my resume

I believe he also said if I were to have an on-site interview, they would just want to see if I would fit in or not. I don't recall him mentioning they would ask technical/coding question for the on-site interview. They have now decided they want to bring me on-site.

Since I only have a few days to prepare, I wanted to prepare for technical questions since I've never had an on-site interview for a data science or software engineer role that did not involve some technical questions. I wasn't sure if I should focus more on ML/data analysis or OOP/data structures/algorithms. Is it ok at this point to ask which kinds of technical questions I should prepare for?

I'm currently applying for junior data sciencist jobs here in germany and already had a few very positive job interviews (mostly on phone). One of the places invited me for a a ""getting-to-know"" day. It sounds like it's mostly for me to see the place ""in action"", see what kinds of projects the data science team is working on and stuff like that.

However, at the end of the day they want to give me a small dataset and want me to prepare a short presentation on that data witihin an hour. They said it's not about my coding skills and, in fact, it's fine, if I prep the figures in excel. They rather want to see how I look at the data, which questions I ask and how I interpret it. Sounds easy enough and if it was a neuroscience (I'm a Neuroscience PhD) topic, I wouldn't be worried at all. However, that company does mostly consulting and works with data from their clients websites. 

So, my background involves no business stuff, sales or whatever at all.

Battleships Monte-Carlo Simulation,"I recently tried to build a neural reinforcement agent to play the game [Battleships](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/the-basic-rules-of-battleship-411069), however I was not able to successfully get it to work, [original post about that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ab2jdh/battleships_reinforcement_learning/). (Still willing to accept any advice on this front, I refuse to accept defeat! 😁)

&amp;#x200B;

Not wanting to give up on the project, I decided to research some other methods of building a Battleships AI and decided upon [Monte-Carlo Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). It's nothing new, it's been done before with Battleships, but it was still a very good learning process for me.

&amp;#x200B;

It wins in an average of about 45 moves, which seems to be near the best possible with a standard Battleships layout.

&amp;#x200B;

I've generated some heatmap gifs that show how the AI values each tile throughout the game. I thought they might be worth sharing because they are quite pretty and interesting!

Looking at the heatmap, you can very clearly see how it is 'thinking' or building a model of where it is likely that ships are. When it hits a target, the nearby squares light up and the rest of the board darkens, giving it a set of very likely squares that ships will be located, allowing it to replicate the strategy a human might employ of targeting squares adjacent to previous hits. Once it destroys the ship, the rest of the board lights up again and it starts efficiently working its way diagonally around the board looking for new targets.

How to structure this recommendation system with implicit transactional data?,"I've never made a recommendation engine and want to practice/learn with a dataset I have.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The data:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Each user has a current inventory of products (rough range of 0-100 items)

&amp;#x200B;

Each users has a transactional history of buying and selling items. (range of 0-1000 transactions - which can be for the same inventory item).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The goal:**

&amp;#x200B;

To be able to recommend a new product to buy based on the users current items in inventory as compared with similar users from the global cohort.

&amp;#x200B;

**More Info:**

&amp;#x200B;

I can create a ton of features surrounding each user and each product.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no explicit rating, just whether what each user did in their situation (held ABC products at time X, need purchase was for product Y).

&amp;#x200B;

I realise there are probably some non-ML approaches that will work here (and would be nice to know about them) but I specifically want to practice an ML approach for this.

I want data science/ML job but I have non computer science background (Chemical engineer). Thoughts?,"Little background

I graduated in 2018 and I rejected the job i got in my campus placement. Its been about 6 month and i have devoted myself to become a data scientist.

I spend 1st month improving my coding skills (data structure and algorithm) and learning python and C++.

Next I learned the basic data science tools mostly python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikitlearn) and practiced them on keggle.

on The basis of this i got an internship at a small consulting based startup. I did some NLP based project there but there were no cool projects.

After intern ended I completed deeplearning specialization course by Andrew ng on coursera. I definitely had great time.

Today I had my first data science interview,"A little of context, I'm an industrial engineer with sales, marketing and strategy background, already learning ""machine learning"" and just trying to get a job in this field. My knowledge is decent python, decent sql, some decision trees, some RF, some unsupervised classification (just naive bayes). Yes, a noob.

Yes, I'm not statistician, I'm not coder, I'm not a lot of things but a guy learning and jumping to the new.

Even with this bag of inexpertise, I got an interview. It was a groupal one, vs statisticians, coders, even a physicist already doing a PhD. I think I did it ok, just because non data science related questions were made. They just ask us to talk about a case, in which some company got a bad review about its recommendation algorithm, and what would we do to improve it.

The technical guys talk about some algorithms, the coder ones talk about the way in which they got the data, and I talk about strategy, segmentation and client lifecycle.

I don't know if I it was a wise decision, but I really think that those things, as in any business, are the key of success rather than the technical and specific things.

The good news are that they are willing to train the selected candidate (in fact they need 2 guys), so Im hoping the best.

[Grad School Resume Advice] Career Changer Seeking Advice on Resume,"Hi everyone, 

I will be applying to stats/cs grad programs within the next month, and I was hoping to get your feedback on my resume. I come from a non-STEM background, but I have slowly taken a lot of math/stats/cs prerequisites after finishing my professional masters degree related to public administration. 

I've never had to highlight technical abilities on a resume before, and I'm not sure if what I have will catch the eye of the admissions committees or if I have any glaring mistakes. So I'm interested in any and all feedback regarding this draft resume. The ""Motivation"" section at the bottom is nontraditional, but the idea is to convey why I'd like to get a graduate degree outside of my current field. Let me know your thoughts on this. 

Please note, I am only interested in graduate programs that are online or that I can attend live stream. I've watched all of the admissions webinars for the programs I'm interested in, and they all said to highlight any online class experience that a student has. So I have done that and don't think I should take that off my resume. 

Thank you very much for your help.

User's that do X are n times more likely to do Y,"Hi guys, had a quick question I was hoping someone could help with.

It's common to hear people say things like ""individuals who smoke are three times as likely to develop lung cancer than those who don't"".

I'm looking at more rigorous online courses to learn data science, and I've come across a paid ""Data Science Foundations"" course from the Data Incubator.

"What is the industry standard way for determining feature ""importance""?","My understanding is, there are different tests to run such as ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation, Chi-Square.

How to fill in missing value due to inconsistent frequency/time frames?,"So, I'm new to data science, and I am trying to learn by doing some of my own projects. But as I am going along, I frequently come across one issue with data. That issue is that a lot of data is not sampled at the same frequency as other amounts of data. For example, I may be trying to predict GDP using stock prices. But GDP is sampled by quarter, and stock price Is sampled by day. This will obviously create a problem with the data. 
Another issue that I come across is that often data has different time frames. For example, one dataset may be from 1940 to 2018, and another may be from 2000 to 2018. This will also cause some missing gaps in the data.

Data science career advices needed," 

I'm currently a MIS student .It's not called MIS where I lived , but it's basically business degree with some IT and like java and SQL classes.

I was a computer science student before, but it was back when I didn't really care about school and dropped out because there was too much work.

Now, I'm really motivated and I keep trying to find what I wanna do in life each day. But afte a lot of searching I think I wanna go in Data science/BI or database administrator.

Should I go for a master's in business analytics or business intelligence? I read online that it's a lot better to go with math,stats or another quantitive field to get into Data science.

Since I'm finishing my major soon, I consider to go in the Business analytics masters to go more technical and have a easier time to get into Data Science. (and also learn programming in my spare time). I cannot to a masters in math,stats or etc.. because I don't have a STEM undergruate degree.

Prediction as Service (in production),"Hi there,

I'm an Software Engineer without any type of background in data science or any relatable topic.

I'm trying to improve an existing project that uses a trained model/prediction algorithm done in R. 

I added a library that enabled me to have the existing code wrapped within an API (RestRserve).

My question or starting point of this discussion is: how do you solve this issue? How do you make your models/algorithms ready to communicate with other systems? 

I'm talking about production ready services with scalability and efficiency as priority.

The more I understand R and it's inner workings I become to think that it's not the ideal solution.

Let me know what you think.

Need Career advice For DataScience," I'm currently a MIS student .It's not called MIS where I lived , but it's basically business degree with some IT and like java and SQL classes.

I was a computer science student before, but it was back when I didn't really care about school and dropped out because there was too much work.

Now, I'm really motivated and I keep trying to find what I wanna do in life each day. But afte a lot of searching I think I wanna go in Data science/BI or database administrator.

Should I go for a master's in business analytics or business intelligence? I read online that it's a lot better to go with math,stats or another quantitive field to get into Data science.

Since I'm finishing my major soon, I consider to go in the Business analytics masters to go more technical and have a easier time to get into Data Science. (and also learn programming in my spare time). I cannot to a masters in math,stats or etc.. because I don't have a STEM undergruate degree. But business analytics accepts people from a business degree.

Is it a good idea ? Have any advices for me?I like math and I feel my major lacks math. So I'm kind of lost on what to do next.

25 Big Data Terms You Must Know To Impress Your Date (Or whoever you want to),"**Algorithm:** A mathematical formula or statistical process used to perform an analysis of data. How is Algorithm is related to Big Data? Even though algorithm is a generic term, Big Data analytics made the term contemporary and more popular. (Bonus: Here’s a pickup line on your date, ‘You show me your algorithms and I’ll show you mine.  ….  Ok, Ok, I’ll stop! No more cheesy jokes)

**Analytics:** Most likely, your credit card company sent you year-end statement with all your transactions for the entire year. What if you dug into it to see what % you spent on food, clothing, entertainment etc? You are doing ‘analytics’. You are drawing insights from your raw data which can help you make decisions regarding spending for the upcoming year. What if you did the same exercise on tweets or facebook posts made by your friends/network or your own your company. Now we are talking Big Data analytics. It is about making inferences and story-telling with large sets of data.There are 3 or 4 different types of analytics depending on who you talk to.

**Descriptive Analytics:** If you just told me that you spent 25% on food, 35% on clothing, 20% on entertainment and the rest on miscellaneous items last year using your credit card, that is descriptive analytics. Of course, you can go into lot more detail as well.

**Predictive Analytics:** If you analyzed your credit card history for the past 5 years and the split is somewhat consistent, you can safely forecast with high probability that next year will be similar to past years. The fine print here is that this is not about ‘predicting the future’ rather ‘forecasting with probabilities’ of what might happen. In Big data predictive analytics, data scientists may use advanced techniques like data mining, machine learning, and advanced statistical processes (we’ll discuss all these terms later) to forecast weather, economy etc.

**Prescriptive Analytics:** Still using the credit card transactions example, you may want to find out which spending to target (i.e. food, entertainment, clothing etc.) to make a huge impact on your overall spending. Prescriptive analytics builds on predictive analytics by including ‘actions’ (i.e. reduce food or clothing or entertainment) and analyzing the resulting outcomes to ‘prescribe’ the best category to target to reduce your overall spend. You can extend this to big data and imagine how executives can make data-driven decisions by looking at the impacts of various actions in front of them.

**Batch processing:** Even though Batch data processing has been around since mainframe days, Batch processing gained additional significance with Big Data given the large datasets that it deals with. Batch data processing is an efficient way of processing high volumes of data where a group of transactions is collected over a period of time. Hadoop, which I’ll describe later, is focused on batch data processing.

**Cassandra,** a beautiful name, is a popular open source database management system managed by The Apache Software Foundation. Apache can be credited with many big data technologies and Cassandra was designed to handle large volumes of data across distributed servers.  
**Cloud computing:** Well, cloud computing has become ubiquitous so it may not be needed here but I included just for completeness sake. It’s essentially software and/or data hosted and running on remote servers and accessible from anywhere on the internet.

**Cluster computing:** It’s a fancy term for computing using a ‘cluster’ of pooled resources of multiple servers. Getting more technical, we might be talking about nodes, cluster management layer, load balancing, and parallel processing etc.  
**Dark Data:** This, in my opinion, is coined to scare the living daylights out of senior management. Basically, this refers to all the data that is gathered and processed by enterprises not used for any meaningful purposes and hence it is ‘dark and may never be analyzed. It could be social network feeds, call center logs, meeting notes and what have you. There are many estimates that anywhere from 60-90% of all enterprise data may be ‘dark data’ but who really knows.

**Data lake:** When I first heard of this, I really thought someone was pulling an April fool’s joke. But it’s a real term! Data lake is a large repository of enterprise-wide data in raw format. While we are here, let’s talk about Data warehouse which is similar in concept that it is also a repository for enterprise-wide data but in a structured format after cleaning and integrating with other sources. Data warehouses are typically used for conventional data (but not exclusively). Supposedly data lake makes it easy to access enterprise-wide data you really need to know what you are looking for and how to process it and make intelligent use of it.

**Data mining:** Data mining is about finding meaningful patterns and deriving insights in large sets of data using sophisticated pattern recognition techniques. It is closely related the term Analytics that we discussed earlier in that you mine the data to get analytics. To derive meaningful patterns, data miners use statistics(yup, good old math), machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

**Data Scientist:** Talk about a career that is HOT! It is someone who can make sense of big data by extracting raw data (did u say from data lake?), massage it, and come up with insights. Some of the skills required for data scientists are what a superman/woman would have: analytics, statistics, computer science, creativity, story-telling and understand business context. No wonder they are so highly paid.

Meaningful interpretation of hospital chargemasters,"TIL that, effective January 1, 2019, [all US hospitals are required to publicly provide their chargemaster,](https://khn.org/news/as-hospitals-post-sticker-prices-online-most-patients-will-remain-befuddled/) a sheet listing all potential costs during patient treatment.

The problem is that there is no standardization across hospitals, and it is challenging for those without medical training to comprehend the abbreviations in the chargemasters, let alone put together a set of charges for an admission. Additionally, these charges are often the base price for these interventions that hospitals take to insurance companies, for whom they will give discounts on the charges. Even if the patient doesn't have insurance, hospitals may (not always) give a discount to them anyhow. 

Still, it would be great if a tool existed for patients to search for a list of nearby hospitals and see what the costs for certain procedures are.

Need some career advice,"Hi all, I’ve been doing business intelligence work for the past 8 years or so (various types of RDBMS, reports/dashboards, some python). This time last year I took a serious look at my career and it seems like data science was a ‘natural’ progression to greater heights and more interesting work.

ML model that will predict accumulation of points within a cluster,"I have a list of measurements with different timestamps. These are measurements for small devices on an assembly line, after an inspection at the end of assembly.

\- assembly line number

\- timestamp

\- type of error (incorrect placement of sub-parts, non-working circuit etc.)

I'm trying to identify if a ""cluster"" of issues appear or will appear on my assembly line due to faults in my settings or robots handling the parts. At the moment this is done by an alarm being set off after a certain percentage of parts have issues during inspection.

Help analyzing speech in audio and transcripts using R (or a tool in tandem with R),"Hello everyone!

I am doing a quantitative analysis of speech patterns and I’m looking for a tool or programming steps (in R) that would allow me to apply my methodology.

To be succinct here’s what I have and I want to do:

What I have: 
a)	a series of audio interviews files; 
b)	these audio files respective transcripts in Word with i) manually identified timestamps for when subject X starts and stops speaking and ii) timestamps for when subject Y starts and stops speaking.

What I want to do: 
1)	repeated or integrated words by subject X and Y after one speaks the same words (to measure a sort of echo effect or mimicry);
2)	quantify the number and lengths of silences mid-speech by subject X and Y (trying to measure if there’s a relationship between emotional content and the time it takes a subject to say his/her words). I imagine I would have to set the sensitivity to a particular decibel in order to ignore chair movements or sighing or other non-verbal sounds.

Any input will be tremendously valuable. I’ve been dabbling in R for a while now and I am familiar with the tidyverse. What seems to pose the biggest challenge for me is to think of which tools to use in tadem with R to analyze audio content.

Data Transformation Techniques on Database I want apply a Clustering algorithm.,"I am looking for some assistance from experienced individuals in Data Mining when it comes to data transformation of a database.

In data transformation it is easy to apply techniques to numeric data. Noisy or outliers? We can apply a Z-score to find them or use binning. Correlation? Again, we can z-score. Missing information? We can apply averages, medians, etc to fill in the missing data. Even certain word categories like Gender could be filled in using an ""unknown"" category. The problem for me comes with similarity matrix between all values.

Adaptive gradient methods proposed in past demonstrate a degraded generalization performance than the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum. The authors try to address this problem by designing a new optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between the space of Adaptive Gradient algorithms and SGD with momentum. With this method a new tunable hyperparameter called partially adaptive parameter p is introduced that varies between [0, 0.5]. We build the proposed optimizer and use it to mirror the experiments performed by the authors. We review and comment on the empirical analysis performed by the authors.

The authors try to address this problem by designing a new optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between the space of Adaptive Gradient algorithms and SGD with momentum. With this method a new tunable hyperparameter called partially adaptive parameter p is introduced that varies between [0, 0.5]. We build the proposed optimizer and use it to mirror the experiments performed by the authors. We review and comment on the empirical analysis performed by the authors. Finally, we also propose a future direction for further study of Padam. Our code is available at: [https://github.com/yashkant/Padam-Tensorflow](https://github.com/yashkant/Padam-Tensorflow)

algorithm for optimization problem with discrete number of solutions.,"Hej,

I'm working on a project that requires me to find a shortlist  of candidates out of a couple thousand possible solutions, now I have some descriptors and a very computationally intensive way of accurately scoring my solutions so I can only sample around 50-100 of the potential solutions, I already have a 10 potential solutions that have been scored but they have been hand picked and are somewhat similar. I have been reading about optimization algorithms in the context of the optimization of machine learning hyper parameters but those mostly seem like continues variables and you can chose the parameters independently. I was wondering if you guys had any opinions on what would be the best way to approach this. My first instinct would be to take a random sample and than combine the outcome with the already tested solutions and than basically do hill climbing using the descriptors to find similar solutions to the best candidate found so far.
Interested in hearing your opinions.

[P] Obtaining full WhatsApp chat,"Hello,

I'm trying to do a little project about NLP and data analytics and I need to get the text from some WhatsApp chats.

I know there is an option to send a chat via email as a "".txt "", but it is limited to 10k messages and this amount is not even enough for the small of the chats I want to use.

I thought about creating a javascript function to get all the text from http://web.whatsapp.com/ but seems inefficient and it should be my last resource.

Are there any ways to recover full WhatsApp messages from backup or whatever without having to root my phone?

Masters or work experience?,"I’m asking this question as I potentially am interested in data science. However my gpa was subpar so far in undergrad and am wanting to pursue a BA over a BS as a BS only has 2 extra cs classes that I don’t think would help and a physics class that is not related.  These classes wouldn’t be very hard (time consuming though) for me but I just see them as pointless and It would take another semester and I want to graduate ASAP as it’s already my fifth year of college since I transferred twice.

So I have a few options... 

1. get a BA and get work experience and try for data science jobs once I get more experience and if all fail then try for masters

2. Or get a BS (would take an extra semester of stupid courses) and do the above.


I’m just afraid that if I ever decide that work experience isn’t helping and so I want to pursue data science through getting a masters that my BA va BS decision could be significant in getting into grad school 

Any suggestions or experience? Thanks!

Recursive Feature Elimination returns suspect results regarding accuracy," am doing RFE with 18 features. My understanding of RFE is, it starts by trying N - 1 models, and then removing the feature that causes the N - 1 models to perform worst. Then it tries N - 2 models, and so on. I've also read elsewhere that RFE does some sort of weighting. Which one is it? Weighting to me indicates a more math-y approach that requires more interpretation of the ""optimal"" features, whereas doing the N - 1, N - 2 indicates to me more of a brute force approach that requires less interpretation of the ""optimal"" features.

My model specifically said the highest accuracy was with 18 features. However, the suspect aspect was how the accuracy stayed the same when RFE was run with 0 through 15 features (see picture).

Courses to Take? Might want to be a Data Scientist in the future,"Hi all, courently in a dilemna as I dont know if I should drop one class from my current winter quarter session. Im a stats major graduating march 2019. I am mostly applying to data analyst position due to my skillset with r programming etc. 

the current courses I am currently taking are with the following descriptions (well not for design) -hopefully this makes it helpful which might be more relevant to me and my goals. I plan to work for a year or two then go back for grad school to get a masters, am thinking of the data scientist pathway, tho still open to other careers as well. Anyways, 3 of these courses put me at full time and I just feel like I might die during finals week doing all 4. The design exp prof. is awful tbh, but need to take it. If you had to choose just 3 of these which would be more beneficial for my goals? or should I take all of them (willing to put in the work, just something inside me wants to have a more chill final quarter lol)

Design of Expiremnts (requirement to graduate)

Big Data Analytics - Basics in distributed data storage, retrieval, processing and cloud computing. Overview of methods for analyzing big data from both high dimensional statistics and machine learning - topics chosen from penalized regression, classification/clustering, dimension reduction, random projections, kernel methods, network clustering, graph analytics, supervised and unsupervised learning among others. (new course were everyone had to do a application to get in. Learning spark in it and pyspark as well a jupyter notebook.)

Advanced Statistical Models- Exponential family and generalized linear models including logistic and Poisson regression, nonparametric regression, including kernel, spline and local polynomials, and generalized additive models. Other topics as time allows: regularization, neural networks, and support vector machines. Emphasis will be on concepts and practical applications

Stochastic Process -Discrete probability models. Review of discrete and continuous probability. Conditional expectations. Simulation techniques for random variables. Discrete time stochastic processes: random walks and Markov chains with applications to Monte Carlo simulation and mathematical finance. Introduction to Poisson process.

So not sure if I should drop one and was wondering if any of you in industry would recommend to take all of them or which do you think are most important?

Anyways to see where I am coming from, here are other relevant courses I have taken,

Statistical Machine Learning (A-), Survival Analysis(A-), Time Series(A-), Regression Analysis (A), Mathematical Statistics (B+), Mathematical Statisitics 2 (hypothesis testing, B+), Bayesian Data Analysis (B-), SAS Base programming (C+, ;/ took it in a 3 week period with proof math class in summer, a mistake), Calc 1-3 (A, A- in Calc 3), Lin Alg( A)

how to build pretty county-level choropleth maps with Python,"Hi friends! 

I recently started working on my choropleth map-building skills in Python ([link to my active repo here with work in progress code](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/blob/master/eda-and-visualization/geo_mapping_viz.ipynb)), and as you can see, I have had success building state-level maps--like the [1st one shown in Plotly's documentation here](https://plot.ly/python/choropleth-maps/). 

I wanted to move on to keep the same map layout (with Alaska and Florida in the bottom left) but move to FIPS county-level (i.e. much more granular) data, beyond the state level. Is that even possible though? I dug deep through the docs for Plotly's map functions, and it looks like the only way you can build county-level charts (like the one shown in my second link) is if Alaska and Hawaii are super far away, like they are annoyingly in Tableau, for example.

How do you benchmark your models with real world data?,"Started at an insurance company and my first objective is to recalibrate the underwriter rates using a GLM. I also have to prove that using a GLM has better predictive performance than their current methodologies. I'll do this for the various lines of insurance this company writes for. If/when I get the trust of the underwriters, I will work toward more advanced methodologies that are more black box to help determine what a good/bad policy is or just scoring various policies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an actuarial background, so a lot of the terminology is familiar to me. But as a newer data scientist (6 months in), I've never encountered datasets like insurance data. It's heavily zero-inflated and right skewed.  I also have to consider credibility in the data, so need to weight the data by an exposure. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've spent the past 2 months just researching common insurance methodologies, and testing various models. Since it's highly zero inflated, typical measures of performance (RMSE, R\^2) aren't really useful. So then I discovered insurance has their own version of the Lorenz curve that I can extract a Gini coefficient from to compare models.  

&amp;#x200B;

The data is not linear in any form, so GLM's aren't very predictive. However, they're transparent, and I can extract multiplicative factors that underwriters can use.  I did a boosting method using a Tweedie distribution and got a model I was decently happy with, but it's so black box and I can't extract coefficient.  It gives me an idea of the ceiling though.

Number of samples for linear model?,"I'm working on a project at work which involves building a regression model to predict the wear on a particular component. It involves only one predictor (voltage output of a particular sensor) and predicts the remaining useful life. We are required to retire this component once it reaches a certain percentage of useful life, so we need to know when this this threshold is reached. 

We currently have these components on the test bench being worn at an accelerated rate and collecting sensor data a few times a day. For planning purposes, we need to know how long the data collection will take, and this ultimately boils down to how quickly we can age an appropriate number of components to create a good regression model. 

My question: how do you determine how many samples is good enough? I've looked into power and sample size calculators, but I'm fuzzy on all the assumptions being made behind the scenes. There seems to be a number of effect size calculations to use - Cohen's f seems to be the most popular, but when I use this it gives me a very low sample size (assuming I'm using it correctly). Is the R^2 in Cohen's f the same as the desired Pearsons' R^2? Another thing to note is that it seems Cohen's f is generally used in social sciences so I'm not sure that this is the correct application.

Additional info: a very similar study was successfully done at my company several years ago using the same sensor with very similar components, so we know it is possible. The model created before performed beautifully, and if we were still using these old components, my work would be done. We're basically repeating the study but with the newer revision of the components being worn. I have the data from the old experiment. Is there any way I can use this to help answer my question? The previous experiment was done ""on the side"" so there was no hard deadline on project completion; they simply kept collecting data until they ran out of components to test.

Sorry if some of this is a little vague. I'm unable to give specifics on the components or sensors due to confidentiality agreements.

Is the R^2 in Cohen's f the same as the desired Pearsons' R^2? Another thing to note is that it seems Cohen's f is generally used in social sciences so I'm not sure that this is the correct application.

Additional info: a very similar study was successfully done at my company several years ago using the same sensor with very similar components, so we know it is possible. The model created before performed beautifully, and if we were still using these old components, my work would be done. We're basically repeating the study but with the newer revision of the components being worn. I have the data from the old experiment. Is there any way I can use this to help answer my question? The previous experiment was done ""on the side"" so there was no hard deadline on project completion; they simply kept collecting data until they ran out of components to test.

Sorry if some of this is a little vague. I'm unable to give specifics on the components or sensors due to confidentiality agreements.

Thanks for reading!"

Trust score: how to trust a trained classifier?,"Given a trained classifier, how would you trust its results afterward?

For example you have an image classifier, you give it an image and it labels it with ""X"" label. You flip the image and give it to the same classifier, it labels it with ""Y"" label.

Another example, you do some NER on a sentence, it returns some tags, you reformulate your sentence in a very look-alike manner, it returns some identical tags than previously and some different tags.

In both scenarios, is there a way to say ""input A is more trustable than input B""?

It can be reverse engineering with domain knowledge or whatever, but I would like to assess one input is more reliable than another.

Ideally, I would like for a given input a ""trust score"" and then decide whether I should trust the result.

For example, in my NER scenario, let's say it tags correctly some entities but some are not tagged at all (False negative). A high score will mean a high probability that all the entities were tags and that the tags are correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas ?

For the false negative part in the NER scenario, I've thought about creating a gazetteer with tokens having a high probability belonging to one of the named entities and checking afterward that a token not tagged but in the gazetteer might result in a poor prediction.

You might argue that a classifier that do not tag an input with a high probability of being tagged is a bad classifier, but in this special case of NER  and optimizing for F1 score it is not true.",datascience,1547659677,Laippe,10,1,True,2019-01-16,1,"Trust score: how to trust a trained classifier?

Any thoughts on joining innovation + data science?,"Hey all! I am a chemical engineering graduate but i have worked in startup development since i graduated 6 months ago and i will be starting a masters in innovation and entrepreneurship in august.

Even though i really like startups and innovation, i have started to take DS courses online and i really like it. I have started to think about how i could combine both after i graduate from my masters, specially because i would like to take more advantage of my engineering degree.

Is there any corporate role you know of that combines both? For example, product managers need to know about innovation (design thinking, user research, etc.) but also about programming and design. 

The only role i can think of could be a product manager for a company whose products are DS based, but i am sure there are many other roles out there.

Switching Career to DS/ML,"Hi all,
I am an electrical engineer. However, I started my career as software engineer. Didn't enjoy it, so I decided to pursue MSEE. Its been 6 years now I have been working as hardware dev/ validation engineer. I am not happy with they way my career is progressing. Below average and under market pay. Few years ago I was fascinated by DS/ ML. So I completed course by prof Andrew ng on Coursera. 

Now, I am thinking about career change, again, to DS/ML.
But, I am 36 and I feel like no matter how much of an effort I put into it, I will be behind the curve. I m trying to finish Titanic submission on kaggle for a year now. It's tough balancing work, interest and personal commitments. 
I don't know if I should stick to what I know or learn what I don't know. I feel I should focus more on my software skills in python and algo instead and take a spectator approach to DS/ML.

Anyone in the same boat  as me?

 I wonder what would a recruiter think if s/he looks at my resume which seems out of focus.

Considering other options from data science,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone decided to move away from data science work?

I find myself not enjoying the data science aspect of my career where I've been at a start up for around 3 years and much of my role has also been Database analysts, reporting and building dashboards in Power BI and now that we have hired more people I have been focusing much more on the data science work,

But what I find I enjoy the most is the SQL querying, automating tasks and ETL in Python, and building dashboards and doing more 'Analytics' work.

&amp;#x200B;

I just find machine learning very tedious with the parameter tuning, cleaning data, running up models on EC2 etc.

I also am quite disillusioned with modem machine learning where they are very hard to interpret to the business and it might be that my maths is not strong enough to truly understand what I am doing.

Calculating Data,"Good Day Everyone,

I'm relatively new to the big data scene. Some context before I throw in my inquiry. 

I'm a self taught data analyst. Started career as a marketer, moved to operations, and wanted to reinvent myself as a data analyst doing customer lifecycle management after realizing that I could not carry the team further in operations.  


Currently I've been generating reports for the various department heads via excel. Part of this new year goal is to see how well we're doing on a week by week basis and react to them if we can. My question is 

1. How do most analyst calculate weekly data if first day of the month is Tuesday instead of Monday? Do they set Tuesday as the default throughout the month? For example this month of Jan 2019, where the first day is a Tuesday  

2. Following up on the first question, since Monday is part of last month's data. Should Monday be considered part of the weekly data or instead starts on Tuesday and thus it being a shorter week.

a more specific question on how to cluster a dataset with a majority of records being category values over numeric values,"Clustering a dataset is relevatively easy if you have a lot of attributes that have numeric data. For example if I were to cluster credit card data which contained attributes such as age, salary, limit, number of cards, debt, and rating, all these attributes have discrete numeric data which I can use a euclidean square distance algorithm to calculate a similarity matrix and apply this matrix to a K-means or K-Mediod or Birch algorithm and get a cluster. 

But what if your attributes are more category based? For example, Ethnicity, County, Gender, CurrentStatus, Major, Race, Married, Student, etc? How do I measure similarity between such categories? How would I cluster a database that has such a majority of category attributes? Are there tricks in converting categories into numeric values that could potentially be used with Euclidean squared distance, or are there other similarity algorithms? 

For example on the website,[https://www.psi.toronto.edu/index.php?q=affinity%20propagation](https://www.psi.toronto.edu/index.php?q=affinity%20propagation), which the website for Affinity Propagation, there is a section for  **DETECTING REPRESENTATIVE SENTENCES IN A MANUSCRIPT** to which a similarity matrix was constructed using information coding costs. According to their paper they constructed the similarity matrix in the following way, ""To identify a small number of sentences in a draft of this manuscript that summarize other sentences, we treated each sentence as a “bag of words” (6) and computed the similarity of sentence i to sentence k based on the cost of encoding the words in sentence i using the words in sentence k.""

Future Career Advice,"Hey all,

I am currently a CS student on track to graduating by fall of 2020. I plan to work in the field of data science and maybe eventually try to get involved in a startup. After I graduate, I plan to either go to grad school or join the industry.

I am debating whether or not to postpone my graduation to the spring of 2021 and pursue a computational math degree as well. Why or why not should I do this? I am unsure because I do not know how much the second degree will actually influence my ability in whatever endeavor I pursue (industry, grad, startup). Is it better to just get in and out of college ASAP and pursue real experience? I also do have some passion for math, but I am unsure whether that is enough to stay in college longer.

P.S. I have enough financial aid and scholarships to cover the extra costs. By pursuing the second degree, I will have to do two extra semesters (summer 20 and spring 21).

Where should I start if I would like to create a website or program that will organize and alert when a date counts down.,"This may sound a bit crazy but  I need a bit of help and this is data science I am pretty sure.

Hello! I just got into computer science and I am about halfway into my course AP Computer Science in school involving Java. My father owns a company where storing dates when they visited someone's house is essential and he needs a way to get a reminder that every ""x months"", he needs to go back to the house. This is my idea for a program or website to help his issue, but I do not know where to start due to my lack of knowledge with data storage. If any of you know websites or videos that may help me with my problem, please share them! I am pretty much clueless. I do not mind learning anything needed in order to complete this.  Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

This will be a website where the main screen is a list of all the houses he visited and how many days until (x) months passed. In the top corner, you can add a person with information including: Name, email, price, address, date visited, and you can favorite them. If you click on one of the names on the list, there will be a drop-down menu with all the information about the client. You can also customize the months that you are counting down to. More features would be hopefully added when or if I complete this project because I believe this is also going to be a very nice learning experience for me.

\- I am a senior undergrad graduating with a BS in Information Systems this upcoming May. My school is ranked pretty high for CS, and my degree involved a good amount of CS course work (done a good bit of programming, data structures, etc) Plus I took a applied math and stats course last year. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I will be taking a Data Science course offered by my school in my final semester this spring.

\- I have taken both Intro and Intermediate Python for Data Science on DataCamp

\- I am currently reading The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book

&amp;#x200B;

\- After finishing the book, I plan to take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course that everyone seems to recommend.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I consider myself to be competent with SQL, and I have created my own relational database for a project so I am experienced and have a pretty good understanding of databases.

Predicting with varying levels of certainty,"Hello,

I am working on a regression prediction model that is trying to predict energy consumption without prior information, so modelling it based on things like Age, location, house size etc

This returns a R-Squared of 0.70  which is not horrible but not great using a light GBM. 

There is a huge amount of variability between subjects with a very right skewed distribution.

The problem is, I have been asked to identify the predictions that the model is confident with, say it fits within a 95% confidence interval or something, and those that don't need to be pushed into a new process that will ask for more data which will increase the prediction accuracy.

Is there a way of identify those that the model is confident from a xgboost/lightgbm model?

There is a cost associated with large over and under predictions, under predictions are more costly to the business though.  ",datascience,1547866964,InfinitePermutations,7,1,True,2019-01-18,1,"Predicting with varying levels of certainty Hello,

PCA and MCA Combo vs. FAMD to condense large feature set of continuous and categorical data,"Greetings,

I was hoping to get some input from more experienced data scientists on how you prefer to condense features into a manageable set. The full training sample I'm looking at is ~9,000,000 rows and only taking one hots for categorical variables with less than 150 unique values expands the sample to around 1000 features, putting me right on the border of a memory error in python. This still leaves approximately 20 categorical variables that I would be dropping from the dataset because my machine can't handle them.

My initial thought has been to take a stratified sample of around 300,000 rows, then do PCA on the continuous variables and  MCA on the categoricals then concat the two together. I'm thinking this is the best for me pipeline wise because the prince package has both fit and transform methods for these (I believe FAMD only has a fit method, so I'm unsure how that would actually transform test data). From what I've read on The Google so far, the other option is FAMD if I want to perform factor analysis on one dataframe.

My main question: How do you more experienced data scientists prefer to condense large, varied datasets? Do you have a preference between the two methods I described above? Do you spend lots of time pruning categorical variables before one hot encoding to mitigate the memory issue? (locally, I assume in a production environment something of this size or more would probably be distributed).... What else do you do in the data transformation process to condense your feature space into something workable?

Notes:

-I'm using python. That said, I don't mean to limit discussion to python implementations.

-I'm a Data Analyst. By that I mean I have a decent bit of practical knowledge of CRISP and considerations that need to be taken during the model building process. I also mean that I lack the stats background that I feel (Nay! Know!) is necessary to make truly informed decisions here.

That said, the project I'm working on has already been a tremendous learning experience for me, and running into this issue has been the icing on the curiosity cake for me. Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Data analyst internships viable while in community college?,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I'm a 2nd year community college student who will be transferring into a 4 year this fall for a BS in Statistics. I decided I'd like to work as a data analyst after graduating and was wondering how viable it is to get an internship this summer if it is even possible given they ask for students enrolled in 4 years.

Technically I'm not enrolled in a 4 year \*yet\* (and don't even know where yet), and wouldn't have that kind of status until after spring when I submit my intent to register so by then it would be way too late.

In that case what should I do in the summer? Just personal projects? All I have under my belt is math and stats prereq courses and basic programming that is required for the major (one course in C++ and one in java). It seems most data analyst internships require knowledge of Python/R/SQL which I don't have yet but could self study and work on some personal project over the summer.

I'm wondering if this will even be enough come fall when most internships open up for the next summer, it would technically be my last summer before graduating and the timeline is just so compressed since it feels like a lot of peers who went to 4 years as a freshman already have internships after their 2nd year which just doesn't feel possible with the timeline of transferring.

Resume critique for PhD student," [here](https://imgur.com/lySFsTI) it is.

&amp;#x200B;

The stuff is red are things I've omitted/changed for pseudo-anonymity.

Some notes:

(1) I'm not a CS student. I'm a 5th year PhD student from an engineering field. My research is in scientific computing, specifically in computational physics, with use of machine learning and supercomputing. So heavy use of math (numerical methods), science, programming, parallel computing

(2) I went to UT Austin for undergrad but have no room to put this. Maybe there's something I could omit to put it in there?

(3) I have 3.8+ undergrad and grad GPAs but don't feel like putting this on there (I'm not really happy about my GPAs) unless it matters?

(4) This is resume is intended for machine learning, data science, HPC, SDE (:nervous:) positions. As such, I left my experience as mostly high level stuff without going into any detail on numerical methods or physics since I doubt anyone's going to care or understand that stuff. I only put regularized least squares in there because I guess it's a buzzword in regression analysis? Except I don't use it for regression.

"Data science is not about how you can apply one machine learning algorithm to another, it is about how to use ML to creatively solve problems","I’m currently a data scientist with about a year of experience, and was lucky enough to be in a position where I really get to use data science (ML algorithms) to solve problems. The more experienced I get, the more I realize that the difference between a senior and a junior data scientist is that the senior people are a lot better at solving problems creatively. This means they can combine methods and techniques to obtain the best outcome. Granted, a lot of it come out of having more experience, but having this mindset is already helpful for me to evolve into a senior data scientist.

For example, you want to predict what’s the likelihood of a customer to buy a certain product given all the buying patterns of this customer. Sounds like a straightforward problem and your random forest or xgboost algorithm is perform decently, say at .65 AUC. What do you do next? Being a junior data scientist, I’d do a bunch of hyperparameter tuning, testing ensemble methods, etc. to get a slight improvement. But a senior data scientist will suggest to first cluster customers into groups, then run the algorithms on each of these clusters. In many cases, this will improve the model performance, if not significantly. This is an oversimplified example of how you can combine methods to obtain a better outcome. There are many many other problems I have seen in my work that are never straightforward, and you have to think hard and be really creative to apply ML to solving them.

KDD And Models,"I'm a bit familiar with KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) and have seen this formal process applied in machine learning, however, can this process still be applied in use cases where individuals are simply just trying to ascertain additional information or knowledge from their data when not using machine learning?

In turn, you develop a solution for them that provides that data allowing them to diagnose faults quickly. Is KDD still applicable in this use case? Is the data model what you provide them to answer their questions? Again, machine learning has not been used.

Learning Curves in Prediction Model?,"Hey everyone!

My main question is: how can I use learning curves to predict an outcome variable?

One of the things we would like to see is whether the learning curve (= average grade per every semester of the bachelor psychology) predicts success. I'm not sure which model I'd have to use for this, nor which test. We'd have to do it in R (course requirement), so any advice on which test / model / or how to do it in R, or links, are very much appreciated!

Not sure if it's relevant but we have the results of around 4000 students, both masters and bachelor.

Predicting Outcome of NFL Games,"A bit of background: I've scraped together 4 seasons of NFL game stats (a little under 1,100 games) and am trying to figure out the best way to predict straight up winners. Here's an example of the layout of 1 row - i.e., game:

&amp;#x200B;

    `Date 	year 	team 	opp 	team_score 	opp_score 	team_first downs
    2014-09-04 2014.0 SEA 	GB 	     36 	  16 	           25`
    
    `team_net pass yards 	team_total yards 	team_turnovers 	team_time of possession 
     	 191 	                  398 	              1 	        33.33` 

&amp;#x200B;

There's about 40+ more columns of potential stats for each game too. What I did was make each game 2 rows, so each team for each game has their own row with 'team' stats and 'opp' stats - as well as a \`home\` either \`0\` or \`1\` to keep track of who's playing where. Of course, there is a \`win\` column of either \`0\` or \`1\` which is the target variable. Total, the data have around 2,200 rows.

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate goal is to have a model simulate a match-up and provide a probability of the winner; e.g., \`NYG\`:\`10%\`, \`LAR\`:\`90%\`. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is where my head unfortunately starts to spin, and I'm frankly not even sure if i've set the data up in an efficient manner. My first thought was to fit a classifier method like logistic regression/random forest (and maybe something like RFE to reduce the features) to try and predict a ""winner"" for any given game, but i'm not sure that's useful when so much has to be taken into account concerning who they're playing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering what, at first glance, the best route might be to set up such a model.

Best degree pathway to becoming a Data Scientist,"Hi guys,

First of all I want to acknowledge that I know becoming a data scientist is much more than graduating with a master's degree. But I'm not here to discuss that, I'm actually comparing 3 sets of degree pathways and asking for which one is more appealing to an employer for a data scientist role.

1st pathway - Bachelor of computer science, master of statistics

2nd pathway - Bachelor of Data science, master of statistics

3rd pathway - Bachelor of Data Science , master of IT (Data Science &amp; Engineering)

4th pathway - Bachelor of computer science, master of IT (Data Science &amp; Engineering)

Sidenote: please don't say things like ""degree choices don't matter employers are not going to focus on that"", ""do what most interests you"" ...

I'm definetley aware the degree I choose out of these will have minimal to no impact when compared to experience but I basically have no preference right now out of these so no harm's done by letting me know which pathway by name sounds the best.",datascience,1548064470,Riftwalker101,17,1,True,2019-01-21,1,"Best degree pathway to becoming a Data Scientist Hi guys,

Dealing with Categorical Variables,"Dear /r/datascience , I am relatively new to machine learning. I have written a Neural network and it works for other data-sets than the one i would like it to work on, which is why i believe something is problematic with the way i handled my data. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the biggest issue is that i encoded my categorical variables (i.e. weekdays) to 0 1 2 3 4... and so on for the various weekdays, however i realise this does not do anything particularly useful due to my sigmoid activation function which pushes it to the largest or lowest categorical variable. 

&amp;#x200B;

But most importantly, my NN does not seem to converge (again, only for this specific data-set). How would you go about tackling this categorical classes issue? I was thinking of the following 2 possibilities: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) making a column for each weekday and giving 0/1 values. For example one column for Monday, one for Tuesday, etc. and then filling it with 0/1's. 

2) Taking the most frequent day and putting either 1 if it is the most frequent or 0 if it is not (or 0 if it is the second most frequent, not sure which is most suitable?)

&amp;#x200B;

As of now i have had to do a considerable amount of cleaning on this messy set and my training set is 200x300'000 , so I do not believe that I have a large P small n problem.

Showing actual vs expected change when many expected changes are 0?,"Hi all. I have changed a lot of details in my explanation so I don't out my company, but I hope it still makes sense. I am not in any sense a data scientist, just trying to answer a question at work.

I work for a company that's struggled to expand our user base beyond ""trendy"" neighborhoods in our city. In the few years we've been around we have had somewhat steady user growth in certain neighborhoods with spikes when we got mentioned on a local blog or something. A few months ago our service was mentioned on local TV and we started getting more user registrations, including from parts of the city we've never served before. We have been debating whether this represents ""breaking through"" into the mainstream and gaining in places we would never have before the coverage, or whether the numbers are too small to be meaningful. That is, are these just users that were bound to join given enough time, or is the distribution of users from that period qualitatively different?

My thought initially was: create a rough prediction of how many registrations we'd expect in a zip code if the new users had followed our normal distribution, and compare the expected # of new users to the actual #. This gave some insight on a few neighborhoods where we already had users and gained more. But it does not help at all with neighborhoods where we had zero users, or only had one and gained one (wow, this is 700% of expected growth!)

However, the only thing I have heard back are no's with the exception of one company that sent me a coding challenge. According to the test cases I did pretty well in my opinion but the next day I got back a no.

&amp;#x200B;

 I checked online and it sounds like candidates for data science positions usually get at least an interview around every eighth application. I think I am pretty well qualified for these positions but I have not been offered a single interview. To summarize is there any I can do to change my application methods or become more qualified to be offered more opportunities?

&amp;#x200B;

I have attached my resume and cover letter below.

Another transition to Data Science,"Dear Redditors,
Scrolling through Reddit, I have seen a lot of people getting great advice on how to transition to Data Science, which has motivated me to give it a go. Hope you guys can help 🙂

Data Science has always been very interesting, but I have never considered doing it as a profession, until now. So I started brushing up on my DS skills and started learning Python from YouTube and Kaggle. 

However, I am struggling to find any positions within the Power Electronic industry (in Denmark), where I would use my Power Electronics background and work with DS.

Do you know of any topics, companies, or positions in general, that would be a good target for someone with my background?

Need tips on how to (ideally) integrate Spark on a local Hadoop cluster,"Hi.

I am an Engineering student and am currently working on a Big Data project. I am doing the project one of the Computer Labs in my College (5 PCs - 1 Master, 4 Slaves - Ubuntu 18.04 - Hadoop 2.7.7).

For the first part of the project, I successfully configured the Multinode cluster and carried out the required tasks (Analyzing a [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand) using a [K-Nearest Neighbor Alogrithm](https://github.com/vinitS101/knn/blob/master/KnnPokerhand.java) in Java).

For this I used this [blog](http://kishorer747.blogspot.com/2014/10/setting-up-hadoop-241-multi-node.html) as a reference.  (Additionally, if you think this isn't an ideal configuration, I would love to get some tips and feedback so that my Hadoop cluster works better).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I plan to carry out the same analysis but with Spark on the same Hadoop Cluster. I tried to follow this [guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/databases/hadoop/install-configure-run-spark-on-top-of-hadoop-yarn-cluster/) to set it up (Note: I used the appropriate spark version) and it kind of worked. Spark does seem to start but there are numerous errors.

I am a beginner with very basic knowledge in this. It took me about 2-3 weeks to fully understand, configure and run my Hadoop cluster.

I would really appreciate if you could:

1. Help point out the issues with the resources I linked and how can I rectify them.
2. If you have any better tutorials, blogs or guides that I can read/watch and understand this better please share the links.
3. Am I even doing this right? I have had no actual courses on these topics in College and I am just doing this because the field of Big Data, Machine Learning, etc interest me.
4. How does Cloudera,, Hortonworks etc actually work? I have full systems with ubuntu and not VMs and I have been unable to find a guide or blog that could help me setup either of those services for my cluster of 5 Computers. If these are any good, I would really appreciate it if you could explain it a little and/or link some blogs, guides or tutorials I could refer to.

I have been stuck on this for a few weeks now. Trying to figure out how to run it. Haven't had a lot of success. Any help would be really appreciated!

"Help me improve my plan for next 10 years. Where should i emigrate after bachelor's, and should i do master's?","Hi redditors. It is my first post on reddit, even though i read it for 10 years. So, here is my story.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be data scientist. I am currently on second year of bachelor's in ""quantitative methods in economy and information systems"" on Warsaw School of Economics. I already do subjects of third year, so i'll be done in half a year. The curriculum is not so practical for job of data scientist. All my free time i spent on learning everything from Kaggle, so i can find my first job/internship on my third year of bachelor's (i will have time, as third year will be there only formally, and only two or three subjects will be left for me to attend to, because i will do 3 years in 2 years). 

After that I want to emigrate from Poland to make money. I have a deal with my parents though. It is not important why, but i have to make master's degree beacause they want to. I want to work though. So the problem is to find a country where I will have well payable data scientist job while studying useful master's and where education is cheap (so no UK, Australia for example). After master's I'll move again to the country where i will find the most profitable job( i think of Canada, Australia, UK, but each of them does not have cheap education, so it will be after the master's), work my ass off there for 7 years untill I am 30 years old. Save as much as I can and come back to Poland, buy two flats and one RV and not give a fuck anymore.

Where should i go?

Criticize my plan as much as you can, I have an open mind. I only want to win life.

Your advice on online courses,"Hello guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I am actually working but I'd be intersted in taking online courses so I'm seeking for osme opinions.

I have a master in engineering (applied mathematics) so I got a pretty strong math background and computing. I did a lot of R and C/C++ during my studies and I am self learning Python since a few month now. I am actually living and working in Luxembourg as Fraud Analyst but I am also doing lots of data mining and business intelligence. The studies I usually do are pretty straight-forward but from the boss request to the presentation (SQL, data cleaning, understanding variables etc...). 

However, to me this is not considered as Data science since it's too simple and I'd like to get some skills in it, especially in Artificial Intelligence. 

Have you ever tried online courses? I know there is tons of videos and tutorial, I perfectly understand them, but I think having an organized course would be better.

The R Community Wants You! Participate in the Learning R Survey Today,"We at RStudio education are interested in understanding:

* How people who know R learned and use the language, and
* What things keep people who are interested in R from learning to use it.

To answer these questions, RStudio is fielding a survey to better understand how and why people learn the R language. We encourage anyone who is interested in learning R or has learned R over any period of years to respond. The survey should only require 5 to 10 minutes of your time, depending on how little or how much information you choose to share with us. The survey is linked to in the title of this post.

If you have an interest in R, but haven't learned it yet, that's fine too! The survey has specific questions for you, and your responses will help us better understand how we can be more encouraging to you and others like you.

I plan to present a summary of this data as part of my talk titled ""The Next Million R Users"" at rstudio::conf 2019, and will open-source the data on GitHub shortly thereafter. Educators and data scientists who wish to analyze the data for themselves will then be able to do.

For those interested in this data, please ask your students, Twitter followers, Ultimate Frisbee team, and anyone else interested in R to complete the survey. Your promotional efforts could help R educators and users understand and grow our community.

You will find a full disclosure of what information will be collected and how it will be used on the first page of the survey. The survey does not collect personally identifiable information nor email addresses, but it does have optional demographic questions.

Feature Engineering/Evaluating Potential Features,"At work, I have a data set that contains web traffic data for potential customers. It contains custom ID numbers, the page on our site that each customer visited, and the date that they visited the page. I'd like to incorporate some this information into our existing model, which predicts the probability that a potential customer makes a purchase. But, for a variety of reasons, I can't build out the existing model to incorporate this data and select features from there. I'm having to do this in a silo. 

So far, I figured out the probability that a customer makes a purchase when a customer visits a particular page versus when they don't. For example, 65% of people who visit our ""about us"" page make a purchase vs 15% of those that don't.

But there are other challenges. First, some pages are visited more than other pages, so I need a way to balance effect size and frequency. And, there is a time consideration as well. For example, the ""order review"" page has a huge effect (75% vs 10%), but it is visited relatively late in the customer's timeline. I need a way of weighting earlier interactions more heavily. 

Any ideas for how to help screen features? I'm just looking to be pointed in a general area.

Help with developing a study plan and prepare for future job responsibilities.,"Hello guys.

I started a new job recently at a small company which tries to give more emphasis in using data. Because they are a small company, with a niche product and a big pie of the market, they chose instead of spending a lot of money to get an experienced employee, to get someone that can grow and learn with them during their ""journey"" in exploring the benefits of using data.

The first stage is to make data about the company's products easily available to everyone at the company. To this effect, I am currently developing several reports in Power BI so that in the future the IT team and me won't have to take time of our responsibilities to provide ad hoc data requests to the other employees. This part is easy enough and is going to be completed in a few months, so no help needed for this.

After that the fun (and hard) part begins where I will have to try to provide my own insights gained from studying/analysing the data and hopefully try to implement ML projects such as  predicting the performance of our users, offer a more personalised product, etc.

As there is no one experienced on this field at the company, basically I am on my own and I can follow whichever route I believe is the best. So it would be really helpful if you could offer me some help on where to start.

First of all, I was asked to research what software I could use. My first idea was to learn Python but I don't know if at least at the beginning, to make things easier and the progress faster, would be better to use an analytics suite like SPSS or SAS or whatever. So any recommendations on that? What do you believe the best place to start would be? As a note, I believe the budget would be something like £10000-£15000 per year at the maximum, at least initially.

Second,where to start learning? I did a Masters recently, not directly relevant to data science, but I took some modules on it and that's why I also decided to get this job. So although I have some experience with machine learning, statistics, and doing a small project using SPSS, SAS EG &amp; EG, etc. I am in no way an expert. I guess what software I am going to use would play some importance, for example if I use Python, I will have to learn Python, but in general can you suggest some good books or online courses that you believe is a good place to start for someone already knowing some stuff. I believe something that also offers the chance to implement small scale case studies relevant to real business problems would be very beneficial.

Finally, how do you go about getting insights? For stuff like ML projects such as  predicting the performance of users, although it might be difficult to implement at least it is more or less clear where to start or what you have to do.

Do I run descriptive statistics? Try to find correlations between the data? Look for clusters that are not visible by naked eye?

I started a new job recently at a small company which tries to give more emphasis in using data. Because they are a small company, with a niche product and a big pie of the market, they chose instead of spending a lot of money to get an experienced employee, to get someone that can grow and learn with them during their ""journey"" in exploring the benefits of using data.

The first stage is to make data about the company's products easily available to everyone at the company. To this effect, I am currently developing several reports in Power BI so that in the future the IT team and me won't have to take time of our responsibilities to provide ad hoc data requests to the other employees. This part is easy enough and is going to be completed in a few months, so no help needed for this.

After that the fun (and hard) part begins where I will have to try to provide my own insights gained from studying/analysing the data and hopefully try to implement ML projects such as  predicting the performance of our users, offer a more personalised product, etc.

As there is no one experienced on this field at the company, basically I am on my own and I can follow whichever route I believe is the best. So it would be really helpful if you could offer me some help on where to start.

First of all, I was asked to research what software I could use. My first idea was to learn Python but I don't know if at least at the beginning, to make things easier and the progress faster, would be better to use an analytics suite like SPSS or SAS or whatever. So any recommendations on that? What do you believe the best place to start would be? As a note, I believe the budget would be something like £10000-£15000 per year at the maximum, at least initially.

Second,where to start learning? I did a Masters recently, not directly relevant to data science, but I took some modules on it and that's why I also decided to get this job. So although I have some experience with machine learning, statistics, and doing a small project using SPSS, SAS EG &amp; EG, etc. I am in no way an expert. I guess what software I am going to use would play some importance, for example if I use Python, I will have to learn Python, but in general can you suggest some good books or online courses that you believe is a good place to start for someone already knowing some stuff. I believe something that also offers the chance to implement small scale case studies relevant to real business problems would be very beneficial.

Finally, how do you go about getting insights? For stuff like ML projects such as  predicting the performance of users, although it might be difficult to implement at least it is more or less clear where to start or what you have to do.

using simpler models for data exploration for ideas on feature engineering,"hello,

so i've been modeling for a little over 3 months so i'm still fairly new. my question pertains to 

feature engineering; i've explored creating a small polynomial dictionary and then using a lasso ( or mixed lasso/ridge ) in order to trim coefficients, which didn't lead to the best results.

it seems that in the end, what i find most helpful is to run an decision tree model and a quick linear regression to get a general idea for what the main variables are in the dataset, and perhaps which terms might need further exploration from there.

i've had very small gains from using the polynomial - basis expansion, but have found that finding key features and then trying to use some logic in order to derive some predictors has done some work. also some gains have been found in creating ratios from variables (like admission rate to predict graduation rate).

my last question would be, what are your thoughts on using clustering in order to derive a cluster assignment as a variable? seems like you could just use the average distance metric and assumed your cluster's are fixed, which seems like it would give the right response as your coefficient would be based somewhat off of the cluster's location in fit.

"Confession: I screwed up majorly. Enrolled in a data science masters program, and barely getting by.","I know this is not /r/confession but just need to share. I enrolled in a well known Canadian university's data science masters program ( I am not going to share the name since it is all my fault). It's geared towards working professionals, so classes are in the evenings. 6 semesters/term program, I am in the 4th one and just about done with the final exams.  Two more semesters left, but last (6th) semester is only half, and is meant for Capstone presentations. So essentially, next semester is the last.   My work is paying 65% of the cost.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited at first, but then kind of zoned out and did the minimal work.  The program is not difficult. You can get by if you follow the notes and practice the problems done in class. While it is a Masters program, it is not exactly like a \*real\* Masters degree. Emphasis is on practical problem solving, rather than theory. Many years back in undergrad (Comp Sci), I took one Masters level course, and there a big difference between teaching styles.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's all my fault for putting in the minimal work. I can barely make heads or tails out of ARIMA, exponential smoothing, PCA, FA, neural networks, etc. At best, I can create linear regression models without having to reference anything.  Since I use Python at work, I can clean up the data pretty easily.

&amp;#x200B;

People at work have been asking me how my degree is going. They think I am learning some futuristic Starwars like science. Some people said this is like graduating with a degree in computer science in 1991, data science is that big (their words, not mine).  I have been finding reasons to avoid people, which is wrecking havoc on already bad social anxiety. These days I start having trouble breathing and swallowing. If I quit my job before 2 years, I would owe them \~$35K, which I don't have.  I am so disappointed in myself. I am going to let everyone down when they find out I can only do linear regression. I put my wife and kids through all of this. They wait for me late till I come home on my class days. Life was so much better  before, now i got this burden on my shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

Although if you are wondering, the program itself, and many others like it is pretty good. I mean pros and cons to everything.

2. 4 dense layers, batch size 30 , 1k data points. Trying to classify into 2 categories. 

Possible options i can think of using
1. L1,L2 kernel/activity regularizer. But shall i apply it on all layer or only on selected ?
2 . max_norm but on which layers ?
3. Dropout but where and how much ?

Thanks 😊"
"Confession: I screwed up majorly. Enrolled in a data science masters program, and I'm quitting","Since I guess we're on the topic I'll share my story.

&amp;#x200B;

2017 June. I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience, a publication in data vis, and a physics/math bachelors who spends a lot of time reading books and studying math, physics, and computer science. I pretty much self taught myself enough programming to make a great income, but spent a lot of time thinking I might be interested in a research role at a company not necessarily working on product and being a slave to release cycles. In my self teaching, I've pretty much went through SICP, Cormen, an Automata Book, ISL, Casella and Berger, and even an analysis of algorithms using combinatorics. I'm not a big fan of R so I learn enough python to get by, but don't deep dive because I already have a healthy full-stack dev job in javascript land where I get paid a ton making web apps that are just wrappers for prediction algorithms. Yet every interview no one would take me seriously in interviews to jump onto a team because of ""lack of experience in the field"". Completely open-ended and ambiguous questions using technologies I don't use in my day to day would hang me up every time. SQL optimization? Some obscure function closure in R? I'd get asked it and drop the ball on an interview. By the way, I also get vetted by software engineers and marketing teams. ""You don't know Google AdWords?"" Mind you these interviews are offering almost $20K less than what I make now, because I don't fall into the ""experienced"" category of job applicants and I'm ""entry level"". So I get an idea, since I'm reading all this stuff and I feel like I know enough to get by:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's do a data science masters!

&amp;#x200B;

My experience is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

A pre-requisite class introductory programming in Java because as a physics/math major with 5 years of experience, granted in javascript, cannot possibly learn how to program. It's super fun to spend $4k to learn a type system in Java that I already know since I've used Haskell. Lovely.

&amp;#x200B;

Second class, masters level algorithms class which is the first actual class in the program Useful, but we're just going over Cormen et. al. Which I already read. Another $4K down the drain. By the way, my employer isn't paying for this so this is my cash. Granted there was some stuff I glanced over in the first reading like bipartite graph algorithms and getting an idea of max flow, but the rest of the class was cut and dry simple. Mind you I'm paying $4k to fill a hole in my knowledge that could be filled with a medium post.

&amp;#x200B;

Third Class, masters level statistics class. Useful, but we're just going over the stuff in Casella and Berger. A useful but expensive rehash of all the flavors of distributions and hypothesis testing for all of them. Another $4k down the drain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done. My next class would be a review of ISL. Do I need another expensive hand-holding through a book I already read? Shall we discuss confusion matrices and how to construct trees for another $4k? I'm just not doing it. The other set of classes are in databases and optimization. I can read that stuff on my own. There would have been a total of 10 classes at $4K each, so I'm just not setting myself back $40K to apply to jobs that I'll be underqualified for anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've learned:

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I got a job at a business that focuses on being a tool for data scientists so we have then on-staff as well as sell directly to them I do full-stack engineering. I'm learning that right now data science jobs are gatekept by people who are spending a lot of money on people who are arguably not generating anything on their bottom lines. The standards for getting hired are extremely high in many positions because they simply can't afford a false-positive hire. Keep in mind they don't know what they want anyways, as evidenced by plenty of stories of data scientists who did get jobs but quickly realized they're a one-man show of smoke and mirrors. Companies want to integrate data science into their strategy to remain competitive, but they have no idea what that means for their business. I've learned no to join this rat race. There are plenty of problems for smart people to work on, and data science doesn't need me. 90% of people are using the technologies to detect smiles, and the other 5% credit loan processing, and 5% marketing. I want to do none of these things. I specifically wanted to join a field where I could use more of my mathematics in my day to day, but I'm not willing to sacrifice more cash and an already well founded career for that. As an experienced software developer I make more than an entry level data scientist, whatever that even means since you need a graduate degree to really get your resume looked at. By the way, even with a graduate degree, you better have industry experience or else you'll get bounced by a marketing or finance person in your data science interview, or worse: low-balled.

&amp;#x200B;

What path to go for my career?,"This is a little bit out of left field mostly because I’m not sure who to talk to about my predicament. 

I am currently a full-time Data Analyst, getting good experience and money. I work with a good tech tool kit(SQL, Alteryx, Excel, A little Python and R but self teaching on those). I’m self learning on Hive and Hadoop, and diving into ML. On top of that, I have previous work experience with Google Analytics and Ads(certified), Tableau (Was a full time business analyst), and previously did freelance work. Also, I am self taught in programming(I was really into C#, but handy with front end). 

The only downside...No Degree. As in I do not have a Bachelor’s Degree and as I work more towards Data Science this becomes more of a road block  as many places require Masters and above now. 

I like education, I started out as a chemical engineering major at a great school, but it all got away from me quickly. I transferred, and was aimless...then I got into Digital marketing, stumbled into data analytics and now here I am. I guess I figured why go into debt when I can make more money working. 

My question is should I stop and finish school full-time or continue to do part-time and get work experience?

I’m 23, I have two years of full time experience and just want to make the best of life. I just don’t want to keep putting off something that will be a brick wall in 3-5years.

Any thoughts appreciated thanks! Also my industry/segment is marketing for now.

Little more background: I have just completed all 3 data courses in my university (2 are part of my data science major) and have done the same mathematics / statistics course as everyone (in first year).  If I were to rate myself on key topics, I'd say:

&amp;#x200B;

Programming : 5/10 as I'm only **really** proficient at Python, but with motivation I can master other technologies with some sweat. P.S. I do know R, query languages, C, Java, JS, HTML and CSS, but I would not dare call myself technically proficient at any of them

Mathematics : 5/10 and willing to improve to 7-8/10 if money motivated  

Machine learning : 5/10, I know how to, where to and when to apply some models but with the lack of math intuition, I'm limited as to how far I can understand (i.e. deepest I've ever gone is building a neural network from scratch)

Business, leadership and problem solving skills : 10/10

&amp;#x200B;

Even my own Data Scientist mentor / supervisor (also my data lecturer) at my university has called me a little crazy for \\ considering to jump the queue that most follow which is data analytic &gt; data scientist.  My belief is that the analytic lacks the business sense / confidence / communication skills the scientist has, as the analytic is much more technically proficient. 

I don't believe it is possible to sink hundreds of hours becoming a data guru without sacrificing business skills (as it also takes time to build solid communication skills, need experience presenting to large audiences in order to present well to small audiences). From what I gather data scientists are leaders, and they lead the technical data analysts (in no way do I mean to undermine them) into applying models which the scientist can infer from **better** (this is the problem solving) than than the analyst. And I know that some places use the analyst and scientist term interchangeably but I believe there is a linearly separable model that describes the two. 

My question is: what is the youngest data scientist you have ever heard of?

How doable is it to learn D3.js in 2 weeks and make a full fledged production ready dashboard of real time analytics?,"Our manager wants me to make an analytics dashboard specifically using D3 (because “it is hot” in her words) of our sales/inventory data from the past 5 years up until the current date. She said she believes it’s straight forward and can be done within 1 sprint (2 weeks) for management to use.

I’m 4 days in with no deliverable at all and banging my head against the wall trying to learn D3 so we can achieve the dashboard we want. 

The last time I learned any JavaScript was 2 years ago and obviously I forgot a lot of it.

I’ve ran through some examples and I’ve copied and pasted some code, but I really don’t understand the code well enough to make something from scratch, which is what will most likely need to be done because the code samples online wouldn’t really apply to what we are doing.

I’m 4 days in with no deliverable at all and banging my head against the wall trying to learn D3 so we can achieve the dashboard we want.

I’ve ran through some examples and I’ve copied and pasted some code, but I really don’t understand the code well enough to make something from scratch, which is what will most likely need to be done because the code samples online wouldn’t really apply to what we are doing.

Beginner - Totally Confused With DataCamp,"I am currently pursuing [B.TECH](https://B.TECH) (Computer Science Engineering), in the free time I am trying to learn Data Science.

Before this I have tried ""Introduction to Probability and Data"" by Duke University which was much more theoretical and boring. I have read like 200+ pages of Introduction to statistical learning, the book explained the concepts properly but, I had no place to implement those concepts.

Would it be detrimental to take 6 months off after graduation to further solidify knowledge and practice new concepts if I realistically don't feel ready for anything above a standard data analyst role?,"I got my undergrad in business admin and marketing, then went straight into a masters in Information Systems with a BI focus at a state school.

Trying to get into the Data world.,"Hi all, sorry if this is not the right place for this, but I am 35 and have been in the oil and gas industry as a title analyst. I live in Colorado and the industry is under constant scrutiny and so I am concerned about the long term viability of my career.   I've recently become interested in SQL and I have begun looking at Graduate Certificates in various data science programs. My concern is whether a Graduate Certificate would be enough to get me into the industry and if it is, what sort of starting salary would   I be looking at? Any advice would be appreciated.

I have read advice from data scientists that says it is much easier to understand and apply new ML methods if you understand the actual mathematics/statistics behind the methods, because there are often patterns. I want to be able to keep up with changes in the field in the future, and not just know how certain methods work right now. Is this good advice? If so, what math/stats courses would be the most helpful for this type of understanding?

Fastest way to score a big text dataset,"I have a list of words with a score:

&amp;#x200B;

|text|score|
|:-|:-|
|red|0.5|
|yellow|\-1|
|blue|1|

I want to score a big data set of text strings based on this list:

&amp;#x200B;

|text\_to\_score|score\_result|
|:-|:-|
|red is warm|0.5|
|blue is cold|1|
|yellow is better than red|\-0.5|

In my current work enviroment, this takes about 4 minutes for 100 words\\scores on 3 million rows of 32 long character strings, using SAS. Ideally, I would have up to 10 000 words, and on a dataset more than twice as big (up to 8 million rows).

The basic operation is to loop through each word, and add the score value if the word is present in the scoring data. 

    IF text contains red then score + 0.5
    IF text contains yellow then score + -1
    etc...

The operation is simple enough that I could probably write it in any programming language. 

Is there a no brainer fast\\best practice for such tasks? Is vectorization an obvious better approach? Should I avoid slower languages such as python and go for C? Is this something that would require a cloud computing platform?

UCI or UC Berkeley for Data Science?,"So I'm a junior transferring from another university where I'm studying Computer Science. 

I have the option to go to UCI for Spring 2019 or UC Berkeley for Fall 2019 semester.

I also hear too many horror stories about students at Berkeley, like getting beat up by homeless people. Berkeley is more recognizable and more prestigious, which is one of the reasons why I am considering it.

I am just conflicted because UCI is telling me if I want their spot, I have to accept before the end of February. I would get free housing there, however, it just seems very boring. I've driven around UCI and it looks like a giant business park. 

Career goals is to get into the data science industry and maybe pursue a graduate degree after working for a while.

Pseudo Recommender Systems Questions,"I’ve been tasked at work with building a system to recommend the best store to send a customer to based on where they live and work.

Ultimately I have access to a huge amount of data for each customer, but the system is to be run prior to direct mail being sent, so it will not perform on the fly predictions on a website. The recommended store’s address would be printed on the mailer.

I can triangulate which store is on there way to work by geolocating both address, find the distance between the stores and their various address, etc.

Data science questions I never knew to ask until I started working (and still dont know the answers to),"Here are some questions I have that I never knew to ask until I started working as a DS. I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get a machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there that explain this in as easy of a manner as the articles you've created

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting.",datascience,1544718643,neuroguy6,114,1,True,2018-12-13,1,"Data science questions I never knew to ask until I started working (and still dont know the answers to) Here are some questions I have that I never knew to ask until I started working as a DS.

I’ve been told that you must be obsessed with data science to succeed in this field. The implication being that you must put in time outside of work.

The way I've been raised to think is that a 'scientist'  in a field is a person that has or had a significant impact in that field. For example, that person might have introduced a new concept (Lecun's convolutional neural networks, or Goodfellow's GANs), or they may have solved a long standing problem, or simply made some advancements in the field.

I've seen so many people on LinkedIn, towards data science, etc... call themselves data scientists. Most of them barely have any formal training in that field at all, or like me, have a masters in data science or a related field and have been working in the data science industry for a few months/years. What claim do such people (including myself) have to call themselves scientists? Should I just go with the flow and call myself one so that I can compete with others, or do I keep calling myself an engineer and a data specialist?

"I'm currently a working student attending an MSc in Data Science but I realized less then a half of the courses are useful. Is dropping out and following my own path, showing what I can do through Kaggle and GitHub, more recognized than a degree when it comes to Data Science?","Hi r/datascience,  

I'm a 24 years old software developer from Italy currently enrolled in a MSc in Data Science with a bachelors in CS. As already said in the title, I'm at my final year of study, with 3 exams passed out of 12, and I've started realizing this degree is something of an attempt to follow the data science hype train. From all of these courses, I can feel the utility of only 4, regarding Python, R, SQL and Statistics, whilst the others are too much generic from a person like me who is already working from 3 years in the IT field and quite knows how things are going on. For example, I have a course about Biology, one about User Interface Interaction, Psychology or something really too much mathematical without a direct correlation with data science.  

At this point, since I can only study at night, I'm wondering if spending another 3 years (assuming I can realistically study for at most 4-6 exams at year) in terms of time and money would be a good option, without considering the off days, the bureaucracy and so on because this university is 180km far from my city. This does not mean to stop studying data science at all, but instead switching to MOOCs, certifications, maybe online degrees if they are valuable, with the purpose of building my own *portfolio* on GitHub and constantly participating on Kaggle competitions trying to improve myself as possible. Of course, the choice of going on with the university is the safest, because we all know that a degree is something companies can trust, but when it comes to data science is it still true or, considering my job and the field itself,  it is better to focus on learning as much as I can about the topic and using this knowledge to create projects I can show to people?

Suggestions for “advanced” math to research?,"Hi everyone!

Career progression,"Hello all, 

I work as a data scientist in a big company, at senior level. I have a PhD and also a data science fellowship from a prestigious/well known program. I have a bit of background in software engineering too, so can write production quality code.

When I joined this company, most of the basic business processess are broken and the data was just not in the right shape to do any data science or even advanced analytics. Frustrated with the quality of data and lack of it, I helped build data sources that are crucial to the business. This involved me working in small teams developing applications and databases tailored for the business needs. I should say that, the purpose of these applications could not have been replaced by commercially available software. I did a few data science projects on the side but the biggest impact I made was making these business applications. 

Fast forward 2 years, the three products that I have designed and built are showing great value and expected to generate a lot of lost revenue. And we have data of good quality to do data science. Great for the company but not for me, as this meant I have not done data science for 2 years and built a reputation for my other skills. 

Now, I am in a weird place where my title is data science but company values my software engineering skills and I perceive myself as solution/technical architect. 

I am confused on my future progression here. Should I just jump to another company and start fresh ? Should I force my existing company to change my role into what I perceive? Should I ask them to assign me more data science roles?

Best master programs to get a quant data science job?,"Hi, I was admitted to UT Austin MS in Business Analytics. I'm very happy and it is one of my top choices bc 

1) it is in Texas so less income taxes, cheaper everything including program costs

4) Texas seems appealing; I studied in the NE for undergrad and I'm sick of the cold, high cost of living, small apartments, the NE corporate culture.

Creating model of components and comparing them,"Hallo guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I try to figure out what to use for creating models of, for example, a shaft and compare it to another shaft and compare them to gain informations about differences.

So I have two options: to get data from the CAD software via API and make a model out of it or to use a MatLab model. Can I import it directly or could save some effort with the matlab model compared to CAD? if so, how?

&amp;#x200B;

So far I hear of Numpy, Scipy and VTK and it seems that so far only VTK could be useful for my case.

I would appreciate any help or if you could direct me to some source to learn. thanks i advance!

Time Series Linear Regression not Volatile Enough - What Kind of Tweaks Can I Add In?,"**Disclosure: this is for the Stock Prediction Challenge on Kaggle, tho I am using it as a learning opportunity and will probably not submit a kernel.**

Getting into data engineering,"**TL/DR: How do I break into data engineering and what does a data engineer do? Figured it would be right to ask here as well (already posted on** r/dataengineering) 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 3rd year university student studying Business and Computer Science, and I recently took a relational databases courses where I studied ER models, logical database design and normalization, Relational Algebra, Datalog, SQL, and data warehouses (star vs snowflake schema, apirori algorithm,etc.). I have become very interested in working with data and building data pipelines, the ETL process and hence started to look into data engineering/science. However, I am having a hard time finding a clear distinction between the role of a Data engineer vs a data scientist. Here are a few questions i have:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Who performs the ETL process? the data engineering or the data scientist? (every resource I read gives me a different answer

2) Why is the ETL process so difficult? Does data cleaning really take that much time?

3) What are the main responsibilities of a data engineer besides building data pipeline and ETL? For an established company like Google for example with major data pipelines and an established infrastructure, what does the role of a data engineer look like in such a massive company?

4) Do data engineers perform any data analysis? (I am very interested in the business side of things as well, and I am hoping to put the business knowledge i gain from school into use as well, however I am not very interested in heavy mathematical/statistical models used for things like Machine Learning,  but I am willing to learn if necessary)

5) Can an employee perform both the tasks of a data engineer and data scientist?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, any recommended resources or types of personal projects to practice data engineering and break into the field? I have some experience with web and app development, but I have no idea on how to get started on data engineering and if there are any recommended courses online I can take (on things like Hadoop which I have no idea about) to get a better look on the field.

Random Forest Classifier (Numeric Data).,"Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning method used for classification, regression, and clustering as well. It uses a collection of Trees, where each tree votes on the outcome. In the case of classification, the forest gives the class voted by the maximum number of trees. In the case of regression, the output is the average of the outcomes of all the trees.

Suppose there are twenty different possible predictor variables. If you create a single decision tree, it may have some bias. Alternatively, in Random Forest, you choose a random sample of 4 variables (say) from all variables and build a tree. Repeat this for a number of times, say 10. Now, you have 10 different trees (let’s call a forest) where different variables have been used and created different accuracy level.

Now, these trees give votes to each variable based on the outcomes, this gives a good idea about variable importance and finally gives the value of the predictor variable.

&amp;#x200B;

***Classification and Regression***

Each tree is given a sample of the full data set with replacement. A subset of features is used to create the tree to the maximum depth possible. The data points and features are then used to create the respective CART trees.

&amp;#x200B;

***Clustering***

The dissimilarity measure between the data points is used to create the distance matrix. PAM (Partitioning Around Medoid) clustering is performed on this distance matrix (using an input on a number of clusters) to create the final clusters. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4tnrmfedes421.jpg

***Practice dataset***

To practice on a dataset, you can visit [Analyttica TreasureHunt](https://learn.analyttica.com).

&amp;#x200B;

***Input and Output***

In Analyttica TreasureHunt, you can run random forest clustering by selecting the target and predictor variables. The data should not contain any missing value. Target variable has to a class variable.

The output of the function has a confusion matrix to show classification accuracy and the variable importance measures. It also runs a 5-fold cross-validation and gives the summary of the result. The predicted class is created in a new field in the dataset.

Each tree is given a sample of the full data set with replacement. A subset of features is used to create the tree to the maximum depth possible. The data points and features are then used to create the respective CART trees.

&amp;#x200B;

***Clustering***

The dissimilarity measure between the data points is used to create the distance matrix. PAM (Partitioning Around Medoid) clustering is performed on this distance matrix (using an input on a number of clusters) to create the final clusters.

***Practice dataset***

To practice on a dataset, you can visit [Analyttica TreasureHunt](https://learn.analyttica.com).

&amp;#x200B;

***Input and Output***

In Analyttica TreasureHunt, you can run random forest clustering by selecting the target and predictor variables. The data should not contain any missing value. Target variable has to a class variable.

The output of the function has a confusion matrix to show classification accuracy and the variable importance measures. It also runs a 5-fold cross-validation and gives the summary of the result. The predicted class is created in a new field in the dataset.

Ideas of something to compare logistic regression with,"


I'm going to create a logistic regression model as I'm predicting  yes / no
from some data. The size of the dataset is ~700 rows, so it's pretty small. 

There are about 30 variables, mainly categorical, some ordinal, and a couple of
continuous, but I think there were about 4 or 5 that were significant from
chi-squared tests. 

I would like another approach to model with, that I could compare and contrast
with Logistic regression. I'm not sure what to go with though. 

The goal is to have something that makes sense for this data, but not
necessarily something that performs amazingly. My main focus is accessibility
and learning. So I need to be able to understand and explain the model
(accessibility), and I would like to use a model that provides some groundwork
for industry kind of stuff (learning), hopefully.

Something that leverage's reasonably basic linear algebra, statistics, and
calculus is fine. I can programme.

I was thinking about using k-nearest neighbours. As this is meant to be pretty
simple and I think (?) there are techniques and concepts in it that might be
useful for me if I continue to read about further models after this project.
Another was Linear Discriminant Analysis, mainly because I thought it was a
'classic'. There was also decision trees.

Any suggestions are welcome. ",datascience,1545049101,tukeysbinges,23,1,True,2018-12-17,1,"Ideas of something to compare logistic regression with

Question: best way to compute frequency from transactions without knowing start/end dates for eligiblity?,"If you have a dataset with members and call times, what is the best method to compute frequency when eligibility is not known (i.e. when a member was first and last eligible to make a call)?

It seems there are two possible approaches:
a) count of calls / (last call date - first call date)
b) count of calls / (current date - first call date)

Both of these approaches would bias results depending on the length of time a person was eligible. For example, using (b) above would result in an artificially lower frequency for members who are no longer eligible by adding additional time to the estimate. (a) would artificially increase the estimate by not accounting for eligible time before and after the first and last call dates, respectively.

Method (b) seems reasonable if assuming members are active if in the data, irrespective of the last call date.

Thank you for any recommendations.

Path to become expert with AI and applying it?,"First off, sorry the lines between datascience and machine learning is blurry to me. I love tinkering and building my own IoT that collect lots of data. Naturally the next step would be to apply those data using AI/ML. I am very new to datascience and AI field and want to learn more about both.

It's seems while trying to figure out the right features for AI based on the data I have, I am doing datascience. So I guess from a datascience perspective and with the end goal of becoming good at AI, how should I strengthen my datascience skills to compliment machine learning? Should I not attempt to master both if I want to master AI? I just want to be most effective at learning. Thanks!



Below is what I posted in the AI subreddits.

I am super excited for the possibilities of AI applications in the near future and have been trying to run along with its rapid development. I have been trying to learn everything about it since 3 years ago and even changed majors to Computer Science. I've taken AI which covers things like particle filtering.

The field is so big that I don't even know where to hone in on, since everything is exciting and useful, but some more than others. I feel like we're in the area where we don't even know what we don't know.

What I've done:

I have dedicated myself to finishing Computer Science degree at a top school, even though I'm not that strong technically. Don't think I have the grades for grade school or time. Took formal AI course, that teaches essentially computational rationality.

Have many personal projects I'm trying to build out with Google AIY kits involving vision and voice. So vision as a sort of intelligent camera detecting by classification. Voice to make use of some kind of self improvement of sound, like hone in on a specific sound and become more accurate ( that's the idea but trying to implement ).

Entrepreneurship. I am always trying to find applications. Since I love building IoT and as a side effect collect lots of data. This starts to blur into whether it's data science or AI that makes use of the data or both.

Going to spend my winter break learning Tensorflow and how to use it from scratch to a working model. I was thinking of optimizing the last layers of a provided model, but I'm not sure which would teach me machine learning and TF more. From scratch or optimizing the last layer.

I know everything takes time, but I want to become efficient and grow as fast as possible since there's SO MUCH! I just want to be strong with Machinelearning and AI. It's super exciting and I want to be knowledgable but also able to apply it to practical uses.

Any tips and suggestions on how I should grow effectively would be much appreciated. I don't even know if knowing stuff like joint particle filtering is useful.

I have dedicated myself to finishing Computer Science degree at a top school, even though I'm not that strong technically. Don't think I have the grades for grade school or time. Took formal AI course, that teaches essentially computational rationality.

Have many personal projects I'm trying to build out with Google AIY kits involving vision and voice. So vision as a sort of intelligent camera detecting by classification. Voice to make use of some kind of self improvement of sound, like hone in on a specific sound and become more accurate ( that's the idea but trying to implement ).

Entrepreneurship. I am always trying to find applications. Since I love building IoT and as a side effect collect lots of data. This starts to blur into whether it's data science or AI that makes use of the data or both.

Going to spend my winter break learning Tensorflow and how to use it from scratch to a working model. I was thinking of optimizing the last layers of a provided model, but I'm not sure which would teach me machine learning and TF more. From scratch or optimizing the last layer.

I know everything takes time, but I want to become efficient and grow as fast as possible since there's SO MUCH! I just want to be strong with Machinelearning and AI. It's super exciting and I want to be knowledgable but also able to apply it to practical uses.

Any tips and suggestions on how I should grow effectively would be much appreciated. I don't even know if knowing stuff like joint particle filtering is useful.

Thanks!!"

Learning from multiple related time series...,"Hi all,

I'm looking for an algorithm or technique that I can go search the web and learn more about but I don't even know what to start searching for. Here's what my problem looks like. 

I have some data that looks like this:

|*Machine ID*|*Output Day 1*|*Output Day 2*|*...*|*Output Day N-1*|*Output Day N*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|00000|55|56|...|78|86|
|00001|45|44|...|89|94|

Imagine that each row is some machine and the columns are the outputs on day i. We have many such machines/rows. Now the problem is given an arbitrary machine and its data for Day 1... Day N-1, we want to predict its output on Day N.   


Now this looks a lot like a time series except I'm used to time series being a *single* series of numbers and you're just trying to predict the next few numbers -- rather than having multiple series that behave similarly and you should be able to learn a general model from all of them . On the flip side, I could treat it as a simple regression problem (to learn to predict day N) but what happens if I want to predict N and then N+1 and so on? Treating it as a regression would throw away the time relationships. 

Finally, what if I have other properties of the machine that I'm trying to use in the prediction (i.e. let's say how old it is, how much oil it has left, etc). 

I feel like there is a known technique here that I should be able to STFW for but I don't know what it's called. Are recurrent  NN what I am looking for? ",datascience,1545103861,longestPath,0,1,True,2018-12-17,1,"Learning from multiple related time series... Hi all,

Are you missing the boat on data science? Leverage the Past,"I am one of many mid-career people transitioning to data science after spending less than ten years working as a general manager. It's definitely not for the money. Working as a Jr. Data Scientist, Data Engineer, or Machine Learning Engineer would be a pay cut at this point (except for those unicorns in Silicon Valley and New York.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am doing that proves the most rewarding is adding technical skills to my portfolio. With automation improvements allowing non-data scientists to work with data increasing, specialization will be essential for job security. ""True"" Data Scientists aren't born out of MS programs with 0-2 years experience (after mine, I felt equipped to work as a ""True"" Data Analyst on an Analytics Team or within an Analytics Department). ""True"" Data Scientists (in my opinion and through observation) is they are grown (internally) or sourced from academia or are ex-academics who lost hope after living destitute while earning their education but somehow took a few more courses in data science and leveraged related experience from a completely different industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

But there is hope for those career transitioning people; one thing people often do, and shouldn't do, is mistakenly overlook their past experiences in their industry (that they may love or hate) after completing their data science education. After my program, I went back to the same industry. No new industry learning curve, you no longer have to take a pay cut earning $20K-$40K less than your previous career, now you are in a more senior role (e.g., Director, Chief, Senior Manager, VP, President) responsible for playing an active part in changing how your company solves problems using data. Leverage the skills you have, the industry you know best, whether you like it or not, and focus on optimization, change management, and how your company uses data to solve its problems. You may find that you are the in-house unicorn that the company never knew it wanted or needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

You may also be the champion Project Manager (or assume such a role). However, from personal experience, be smart about staying in your current company unless you love it. My last company did offer a lateral move to a new position, a small salary bump, but not much else. I had to switch companies after two years (since they paid for part of my degree) to see an ROI. Changing companies led to a substantial offer - same industry - different title - different company.

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend anyone considering transitioning mid-careers to hold fast, earn your STEM degree (part-time, evening, full-time if you can). The ROI is worth it. You will be turning down offers left and right (within your past industry - in my experience). You can also break into a new sector and still be successful; many in my cohort completely changed their industry (most were 30 or above with 5-10 years experience at the time). The more senior level candidates had the highest offers. We had two recent undergraduate students in the class who accepted more technical roles (e.g. Data Analyst, Product Analyst, and something else).

What should I do with 1 month data on my energy consumption,"Hi!

I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to ask something like this. I have recently build [a smart power meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp8266/comments/9tjnll/using_an_esp8266_to_read_old_ferraris_energy_meter/) using a small microcontroller. This (apart from showing some data on a homepage) records a timestamp in a database every time 13.3Wh are consumed. By now, I have about 1.5 months worth of data. 

Since I also currently learn about data science at university, I thought I could do a fun project with this data. However, I am lacking ideas what to do with it. So far, I have only classified stuff using decision trees, logistic regression and multilayer perceptrons (using scikit-learn). Since I only have one property here, the timestamps, there is nothing to classify, so I guess I should build something that maybe predicts power usage in the future? Maybe train a neural network that can predict how much power I will use today? 

Can anyone give me a hint on a nice book/tutorial/website for predictions (preferably using scikit since I have already worked with it). Does anyone have any other suggestions on what to do with the data?

B.S. in Geography student considering moving towards Data Analyst positions as a possible post-college career.,"Hello, I hope I haven’t posted to the wrong sub.

So I’m pursuing a B.S. in Geography (with a Minor in Intelligence Analysis) and I graduate in two semesters. I also live within the Washington D.C. metro area which is known as a hotspot for jobs within my field.  

I cannot stress this enough when I say that didn’t even know Data Science/Data Analysis was a thing until my Junior year of College. I literally thought that the only programming jobs out there were just software engineer/developer jobs. I’m just gonna mention my background below and how I got to this current point. 

When I first realized that data science/analysis was a thing, that was when I took a class focusing on Quantitative Methods for Spatial Analysis (i.e. I learned quite a bit about general/spatial statistical methods). Furthermore in that class, I learned how to use R as our assignments were mostly about using R to read a .csv table (which was on traces of cadmium in bodies of water) and thus perform statistical analysis and what I assume was also data visualization). 

My interest in data analytics (excluding GIS analysis) continued when I took a class on web mapping. In that class I learned quite a bit of writing queries in PostGIS (which is an open source software program that adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database). After that was done, I had to make a web application using PostGIS and Javascript/Leaflet. For that class, I had been writing my SQL queries on this website called CartoDB. Once that class was done, I downloaded PostGreSQL on my computer and began understanding how to create/upload relational databases and tables in pgadmin4 (as well as writing all the queries that I remember), which didn’t take that long to get. 

I also took a class in Python that same semester, which taught me beyond the generic basics of loops/declaring variables and I feel gave me a strong understanding of that language. I will be also taking another class in R this semester which will be pretty much building on the concepts that I learned from that Quantitative Methods for Spatial Analysis class I mentioned earlier. I’ve also used SPSS and GeoDA for statistical analysis on a research project that I was working on for another class I took. 
From my research, I’ve come to know/assume two things:

1. “Data Analyst” positions especially within a large metropolitan area like the one I’m living in are very broad and thus I have to take a closer look at the responsibilities/requirements before applying

1. Data Analysts are different from Data Scientists in the sense of the skills/languages that they need to learn, and that I’d be far more likely to become a Data Analyst vs. a Data Scientist based on what I have learned alongside my general GIS skills. 

I know quite a bit about data analytics/programming/databases for someone within my academic field, but I’m still wondering If I’m competitive enough skills-wise for a basic Data Analyst job out of college? If I could magically travel back in time, I’d have gotten a Minor in Data Science, but like I mentioned I didn’t know data science/analysis existed until my Junior year of college and I’ve begun to understand how much it overlaps with my field.

"Data-mining Tools vs ""traditional methods"" (writing code/algorithms) for Regression Models: Thoughts on the Pros and Cons of each, and help with explaining data-mined models to an audience who mostly uses traditional methods?","**Short Version:** 

I have to present my logistic model created using data mining software to university faculty, many of whom have extensive expertise in regression, using more traditional methods (writing code/manually selecting predictors). I'm afraid they will view data-mining analytics tools as ""inferior"" to other methods of logistic regression, and that I won't know how to answer technical questions since I don't get to spend very much of my workday on modeling. Any tips on what types of questions I can expect, and how to explain the legitimacy of data mining methods? (The software I use to create regression models is similar to SPSS Modeler). Also curious as to your thoughts on the pros and cons of ""traditional"" methods vs. data-mining software methods in general. THANK YOU!  


**Long Version:**

For the last 5 years, I've worked at a University as a data-analyst. A (small-ish) portion of my job consists of creating logistic models of whether students will return or not (e.g., freshman to sophomore retention).  I get to spend *far* less time on this type of work than I'd like to because of other duties, and the only tool we have to do this with is a data-mining tool (I understand  it's similar to SPSS Modeler). Basically after spending a lot of time finessing a large, multi-year dataset, I plug it into this data mining software, which automatically creates the model by mining each field for the most relevant variables. It also automatically checks every transformation of each variable (such as taking the natural log or a cube root) if that is the better predictor.  


We have found it to be very effective and accurate for predicting retention, especially as our data has gotten cleaner over the years. However, **here is my concern:** I've been asked to present my results to a large group of faculty/deans etc, many of whom do predictive modeling using more ""traditional"" methods (e.g., manually selecting variables and building in SPSS, or writing their own code and creating models in R / SAS /  Python / etc. The range of faculty background (social science, business analytics, computer and data science) makes me quite nervous about the questions I might get. *For example, I have only the goodness-of-fit measures that our software spits out, so I won't have some traditional ones for logistic regression to share (such as Hosmer-Lemeshow test - I don't have that one and can't get it with my current software).* The model diagnostics I am provided with are Concordance rate/C-statistic, Cox &amp; Snell Pseudo R-Sq, Somers' D, AIC and BIC, as well as of course the the coef, SE, Wald Chi-Sq, and p-value for each predictor.  


My background is a PhD in a social science field, and I have spent the past 5 years as a data-analyst at this university looking at institutional data (mostly data wrangling/report creation/visualizations). Also, the stats I learned in graduate school were mainly ANOVA's, t-tests, chi-squares, and some regression (but mainly theory and not a lot of practice). I love to work on predictive modeling, but I don't  get to spend too much time on it. Bottom line, I'm worried that I'll get a lot of technical questions from folks who do regression modeling day-in and day-out, and not know how to answer them. Any thoughts you have on the respective merits of traditional vs. data-mining regression techniques would be appreciated, as well as any questions you can anticipate I might get. Thanks!

Finance Major with Business Analytics Minor looking to study DS,"Hi guys im looking to study DS after taking a course in data mining.

The course covered topics from ISLR (which i bought and am planning on reading) and other R tutorials for visualization and modeling.

I just wanted to ask how much of DS is able to be self taught and a list of priorities. 

For example, my professor recommended me to learn Linear Algebra which i will be taking an online course on courseva. But idk how i will be able to apply concepts onto a problem. 

Additionally, will any course help me identify which classification models out of a bunch of them that fits the scenario best? For example, logistics regression fits well when the problem is in a yes or no binary response (at least thats what i think) 

I can code models on R by following scriptguides decently. I can visualize decently or at least know how to practice but i dont know which skills i need to fully understand which model to use aside from literally plug and chug any models and compare their F1 scores on a confusion matrix. 

For those that learned DS without a stats or math background, how did you succeed?

One of the many great things about AI research is that due to its intrinsic general nature, its spectrum of possible applications is very broad. One of the possible directions in which we can push forward the AI research is **Medicine**.

In today’s article, we are going to leverage our Machine Learning skills to build a model that can help doctors find the cancer cells and ultimately save human lives. In order to create a system that can identify tumor tissues in the histopathologic images, we’ll have to explore **Transfer Learning** and **Convolutional Neural Networks**.",datascience,1545173596,g_surma,0,1,True,2018-12-18,1,"Histopathologic Cancer Detector - Machine Learning in Medicine &amp;#x200B;

Suggestions for goal reporting and business tracking software?,"I've been task by my manager to investigate different light weight software solutions to track our company initiatives. Don't ask me why they asked the data scientist to do it, but I suppose they needed someone who is 'techy'. Anyway, I've been looking and ended up on common tools like Jira or Trello. However, these seem a little bit work-aroundy so I thought I would reach out to the community to crowd source some more suitable ideas. Perhaps others are in a similar situation?

**Some more details**

 \- Basically we have a bunch of initiatives (\~100) that are flagged with a RAG rating 

 \- Each initiative is championed by somebody different within the company and the status will need to be updated monthly with commentary

 \- My manager wants each initiative to be able to be updated with action items with alerts for each action item to be sent out to the relevant people

&amp;#x200B;

**What I've looked into**

 \- At the moment they do this via a shared excel document which sits on our document hub

 \- At first I thought that Jira would be a good option but it might be too much for what they are looking for

 \- Other ScrumBoard like tools like Trello seemed to kind of work but also seemed a little bit hacky.  These might do the trick but I'm unsure of any other more fit-for-purpose type tools.

Training a model on a target with a binomial/log normal distribution,"I want a model to help me get the expected value of of each row when the target variable is either 0 or follows a log-normal distribution.

What should I do after the Stanford SQL course?,"With help of the Reddit community I came across one of the most engaging course I have ever done, the Stanford Database course taught by professor Jennifer Widom : [link to the course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Home/Databases/Engineering/about). The specialisation contains many courses, I completed the Relational Algebra course, and then the SQL one. My main goal was to learn the basics of SQL.

After completing the Stanford course, I know a fair bit about basic querying in SQL(thanks to the large amount of practice problems the course provides) but that's about it. Not much about creating tables, just a little bit about indexing.

About me : I am a Computer Science graduate(2018) who wants to be a data engineer in the future, currently I am not looking for specifically data engineer jobs, but any data related jobs that will get me started.

I want to up my knowledge on SQL, and there are just so many pathways and courses on the web it is really overwhelming. Will love to know from the community what should I do next to learn and practice more and more SQL?

Few options that come to my mind are :

1. Complete the full Stanford database course(because I have only done Relational Algebra and SQL)
2. A SQL related project.
3. SQL challenges on Leetcode or other websites.
4. A new course related to SQL that contains as much practicing SQL as this Stanford course had (would love to know such course)

How would you visualize text data?,"Hi there,

What is the best way to represent text data?

I've never actually had to make a dashboard because in data science I was usually the one building models and designing the content to be added to dashboards, but not actually making them. I took a data analyst job for less stress and I realized that I've never actually decided on a tool to make one but my boss said it's totally up to me.

1. **Fraud detection**  \- The obvious one I suppose. Profiling payment behaviour of our customers and detecting anomalities.

Can we recognize it as a phising mail. For example following the link in the mail and determining whether it tries to imitate our company website
3. **Security Operations Center** \- Recognizing ddos attacks and blocking them effectively and this area also involves malware prevention. Can we distinguish usage patterns that are out of the ordinary
4. **Automatic data classifcation** \- based on the text in a document, try to determine the class of the document or assign security attributes to it (e.g. sensitive, contains customer data, etc)
5. **Role assignments** \- Access rights are managed via roles at our company. Here we aim to determine if certain employees have more roles than they should have and initiate the discussion to revoke them

Gradient Descent, Lagrange Multiplier, MLE, Bayes theorem

Modeling options for basket analysis,"Are there any suggestions on what models I can use for Market Basket Analysis?  The only one I know is ""Associate Rule Learning"".

NLP Text classification techniques,"Hi everyone in Data science community,

Recently I have been working on various text classification problems like Movie review sentiment analysis, Emotion detection system, Quora toxic comment detection etc. After working on all these projects what i came to know is that all the above problems are solved using same Deep learning approach(Keras/tensorflow/pytorch) using Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, CNN. Only the text cleaning process changes based on data. After text cleaning same architecture can be used for all the problems. 

1) Only the Name of the project is changing with fancy names but everything behind the scenes is same architecture with minor changes. I would like to know if this is case with text classification problems where is the scope for further development as every one have already developed state of the art architectures.  Even I also see lot of these different Text classification competitions being hosted on Kaggle. How should the approach change based on the problem?

2) What difference has to be there while dealing with different Text classification problems?

Where to learn R (and VBA) as as a new graduate actuary,"Hi Reddit,

I am a ""freshly""graduate in actuarial sciences from Switzerland (graduated almost one year ago). 

I am a bit struggling to find an entry position in the actuarial field, so I started thinking what was wrong with me. Apart from the fact that I am a very shy person and the fact that this does not help me selling myself to employers, I find that I lack good knowledge of programming skills in R and VBA.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning R, I have very few knowledge. We did not have any courses on R during our master program, but we used it on a few courses. So I thought it would be useful to learn R. So, I looked for some tutorials and courses and I am struggling to find some. I did the R Programming course on Coursera, I managed to pass the course ( Even if the last assignment was very difficult, I had to look for some help on Internet).

But then I have no further ressources to continue learning. Where can I find useful ressources to learn R. I looked on the first subject in /r/datascience , but the only book which might be useful is ""R for Data Science"" ([https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) . I thought also subscribing to DataCamp, but the courses look too easy.

So, what are your thoughts on this. And do you have any useful ressources to help me learn programming  in R and also exercise my skills in R .

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning VBA, my programming skills are better. I had a one-semester course on VBA and I did pretty well at the exam. But the question remain the same as for R. How can I extend my knowledge in VBA and where can I exercise my VBA programming skills.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to all and have a nice day.

Lies and statistics - how to find an honest data science job,"I'm an engineer at a company that's been building up their data science consulting over the past few years. On projects that I'm on, the more advanced analyses that I do are massaged and coerced into looking like a consistent narrative. I start with an honest basic analysis (such as dividing stores into profitability buckets and looking for characteristics of the top stores), so these aren't any random or unverifiable conclusions, but then for additional steps like removing outliers, deciding which datasets to normalize, showing an r-squared value or not, my manager will choose based on appearances. Or I need to show that we reduced 1,000 potential locations to 16 in three filters, so I go to the meaningful columns and pick values that make those steps look meaningful, like 40% pass, 40% pass, 10% pass.

At first it was just ""for a demo"" and then a print report, but now we're have a product where we anticipate that a new client doesn't have enough rows of data to make a meaningful ""big data"" / machine learning analysis. I've done enough coding to know that some projects can feel like a hack while it is coming together, but most of my work here has been disappointing and on shaky footing.

Is it normal for data science to be hand-wavy? Do you have standards for outliers which then let you identify the positive and negative results in a more scientific way in your work?

Data Science is all about uncovering findings from data. Diving in at a granular level to mine and understand complex behaviors, trends, and inferences.

It’s about surfacing hidden insight that can help enable companies to make smarter business decisions.

* Netflix data mines movie viewing patterns to understand what drives user interest, and uses that to make decisions on which Netflix original series to produce.
* Walmart targets customer unique shopping behavior, which helps to guide messaging to different market audiences.
* E-Commerce Company uses product recommendation engine to end up more purchasing.
* App based Taxi provider analyse previous data to meet up demand and supply of cab in particular area.
* Google Maps uses Data Science to predict best routes.
* Proctor &amp; Gamble utilizes time series models to more clearly understand future demand, which help plan for production levels more optimally.
* Industries are targeting real time analysis to monetize more customer.

Companies have moved towards digital enterprise and real time environment in the past few years. So, Data Science has becoming the most upcoming field in the 21st century and it has millions of job openings.

Data scientists combine statistics, mathematics, programming, problem-solving, capturing data in ingenious ways, the ability to look at things differently to find patterns, along with the activities of cleansing, preparing, and aligning the data.",datascience,1545371882,jahnavi1209,3,1,True,2018-12-21,1,"Why Data Science?

Extracting book title from Reddit comments,"Hey, I'm fairly new to data science. I have this idea for my project to extract book names from Reddit comments to see which are the most recommended. I have no experience with more advanced NLP algorithms, I've only done some basic parsing so far. Do you have any ideas how to approach this problem?

My first idea was trying to lookup different sentences with a website like Goodreads or something. Still I'd have to know which words are likely to compose a book title (it might be one word, it might 2,3,4 or more).

Second idea was to try the other way around - get book names from Goodreads and try to find them in comments. I'm only concerned that it would take forever to do this lookup.

I have all this business data - where do I start?,"I'm looking for advice for a big project. I am new and inexperienced and I'm basically taking a learn-by-doing approach. Sorry if the post is a little long and the question vague.

My father-in-law is an enamel/car paint distributor who does a fair amount of business. He is really excited that I am interested in analytics and he is eager for me to use his business data and help him out. It will be good for me too, because I can get some professional experience.

 In 2015 he started using pivot tables to find products with small margins and experimented with raising prices on these products. He is also notified when there is a salesperson who has smaller margins than others. This seems way to simple, but he really wasn't using this until 2015 and he tells me most small to medium businesses are still not using these basic techniques to make decisions. Because of this, his business actually grew faster than ever during the worst recession in Brazil in a century. He wants me to help him take it to the next level. However, I don't really know what I am doing and I don't know where to start.

I know a little about some machine learning techniques like SVMs, K-nearest neighbors, k-means clustering, etc. I took a MOOC class on intro to analytics modeling. The problem is, I am having trouble making the connection. My FIL has data on the sales history of each product and each customer. It's all on a program called CH systems, which actually has a built-in BI feature which my FIL doesn't know how to use. When he wants to do things, he uses the CH systems database and filters out whatever subsection he wants to work with, and imports it as an excel spreadsheet. I want to start simple; baby steps. What is something simple I can do for him to start out?

It would be best to do these things in R or Python and make reports with Jupyter notebooks just because of money; hoping to use free packages. I'm taking some online courses in python and analytics for business this coming semester.

What do you all think? It's an awesome opportunity but I'm totally alone and without guidance.

Suggestions on a text embedding problem,"I have several samples (~40k) of very short text (~1-10 words each) that I want to represent with embeddings.

Capturing semantics is important, so tf-idf and bag-of-words won't do. Training something like doc2vec might not give very good results since the text is very short. And using pre-trained doc2vec is also not an option since the text is VERY domain specific.

Any suggestions? One of my colleagues also tried LDA and Glove, but it wasn't effective at all.

Then there is lot of P F Z this and that values that I honestly have no idea is. I answered all their questions with what knowledge I have or heard of and completely bull shit the rest, many of which I’m sure is wrong. The responsibility for the position as they described is very exploratory, no one is going to be asking you for anything. You need to figure out how to improve things with the data that the company has. There is going to be a lot of building test cases and finding questions that no one is asking. 

To my surprise, they called and gave me an offer 20 minutes later. I of course am not going to say no to an offer, but I feel way too under-qualified. After signing the written offer and everything, I’m even feeling a bit scared. What should I do to not get fired within a month?

"Credibility evaluation of tax declarations - how to predict conditional probability from a large number of variables (continuous, discrete, binary)?","I recently got dataset for 37000 households with declared income and a few dozens of other variables of various types: continuous, discrete, binary. 

**The task is to evaluate credibility of declared income based on the remaining variables and data sample**, agreement with the general statistics - are there some standard approaches for this kind of problem?

My approach ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08040 ) was to:

 1. Normalize the income to uniform distribution on [0,1] using [empirical distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function) like in [copula theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_\(probability_theory\)). Thanks of it, modeled density of conditional distribution of this variable seems a proper way to evaluate credibility (?)

 2. Model this density as polynomial and predict its coefficients - currently just using least square linear regression of properties of the remaining variables. 

Are there some better ways to evaluate credibility, model conditional probability from data sample?

Which conference to attend?,"Hi all,

I recently got first place in a data science type hackathon, and besides a cash prize I have the opportunity to (freely) attend any conference of choice including flights (I'm from Europe) and hotel.

My background is in aerospace engineering (MSc) and I only recently got into machine learning. I do not have any ML research experience, only really the basics necessary for doing data sciencey stuff. 

I often listen to Talking Machines, and based on that I figured that NIPS and ICML are probably cool places to go. However, I am afraid that since I'm not an ML researcher myself I won't be able to fully appreciate/enjoy it. 

Do you think that for someone with my background (strong mathematically, no ML research experience, only data science experience) it is a wise idea to attend ICML or NIPS in 2019? Or do you have any other suggestions for conferences to attend?

Statistics vs. Computer Science for college?,"Hi all.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this has been asked before. I'm currently a freshman studying computer science and I've just finished my first semester and performed really well. I aced my programming courses and did well on the math courses. Most people think I'm good (altho I doubt this alot haha). It's just that I've realized that I'm not as interested in studying higher level computer science as I thought I was a few years ago. It's alright and I could finish it with some effort. I've just found it draining. 

By doing some side projects and checking my regular reading list, I realized that I think I have a passion for data science instead. It's not just something I've recently discovered. This is something I've been eyeing for sometime. However, some external pressure influenced my decision and made me try the developer career path. But I realized, I just don't see myself doing that anymore.

I do know computer science is a path to data science but I've been eyeing statistics instead since I figured I can self study the coding side of things. I've found stat really fun in the past. I know it sounds like I've made my decision, but I really haven't. I want to make sure I'm well informed before doing either. I wanted to ask which is better to get me into data science? Should I stick it out with computer science or shift to statistics? Can you share how you got into the field?

Undergrad looking to minimize runtime,"Hi,

I’m an undergraduate researcher with a focus in statistics and physics and I’m looking for guidance. Recently, I’ve reached the point in my research where I can no longer settle to wait hours to let my code run due to the size of the datasets I need to work with (1mil+ rows).

A key example of where I’ve run into an issue: say I have 1,000,000+ positional data points ranging V = [a,b]x[c,d]x[e,f], each with 10+ other columns/labels which I use to compute other statistics. First I pre-partition the data into volumes i through n to make the next step quicker. Here I run some statistical tests that can be computationally intensive themselves depending on how spatially dense the data is. In this step I have a routine of like 3-5 functions, each containing nested loops that make this computation ridiculous.

Typically I use pandas to filter my data via basic boolean conditionals but even that takes my computer minutes to run with large data sets. I’ve looked into converting everything to numpy arrays but still it takes too long.

I work on a 2018 MacBook pro, I won’t bother to list the specs because I know they are insufficient. My brothers gaming PC has a 1070ti GPU and I’m looking to parallelize my computations. I’d appreciate anyone who can point me int the right direction to resources that will allow me to streamline my code. If not possible with the hardware I have, then provide advice how to develop a competent understanding in order to make a convincing/informed proposal to use my unis super computer.

Just a final note, I’ve heard about a package called vaex which claims to be a more efficient pandas. Does anyone have experience with that? Also, I’ve used cuda very basically via numba to test out how fast I could speed up matrix multiplication. The barrier to entry for me is knowing what structure/datatypes my code needs to have in order to make the most out of parallelization.

Educational needs,"I am not sure if this allowed on this sub but I need some guidance. I am a freshman college students and my end goal is to either go into Operations Research, become a Quantitative Analyst, Industrial Engineer, Data Scientist, deal with AI and machine learning and other fields like this. I don't know exactly what I want to do just those fields kind of interest me.

Right now I have Calculus 1 under my belt.

Which order should I learn math in for these fields. My major is Industrial engineering and it is suited more for people who want to go into supply chain management or consulting. Barely anyone wants to go into OR,DS,ML or AI. I am not willing to switch to a math major because I like the broad amount of fields I can get into with IE and I would like to be employable just in case I don't go to graduate school immediately after I finish undergrad

I am willing to self study the math but don't know what order to go in. IE majors are required to only go up to Multivariable calculus at my school and the other math courses are specifically for industrial engineering so the mathematics is more focused on supply chain management.

I have seen others on reddit and quora mention that it is necessary to learn Diff EQ, Real Analysis and a bunch of other upper level math courses that are not in my school's curriculum.

I would like a list of the math topics I should learn in order after Calculus 1.

Feature Selection from 1000 features?,"I was asked this question in an interview- Suppose we want to solve a binary classification problem where our response is 0 and 1. If you have 1000 features and 1 billion rows, how would you approach the problem in terms of reducing the number of features for creating Machine learning models? Also, we know what features mean, how many numerical and categorical features we have, etc. 

I answered the question as following-

1. First, we will find the distribution of classes in the response variable to determine whether we need to re-sample the data-set if it's a rare event problem
2. We can drop features which has more than 50% missing values.
3. We can drop categorical features if the occurrence of a class is below a threshold, let's say 20 in 1 million rows.
4. We can find correlation between features and drop features if they are highly correlated (He caught me here as it's not feasible to identify correlations from a correlation graph with 1000 features)
5. We can perform PCA on numerical features, select top K components which explains 95% variance, combine with categorical features and run machine learning models.

Then, he asked what if we want to explain which features were important in prediction as it won't be possible with PCA. I couldn't answer this part. I was not able to ask him what was the right response to this question as we were out of time. And I couldn't find a proper answer to this question over internet. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Good books/videos/websites to learn how to use statistical analysis to interpret the results of experiments?,"Hey all,

Raise a low GPA or take harder classes if I want to go to a grad school (MS STAT/ Data Science)?,"i'm in my final year of undergrad and also planning for the possibility of grad school in the future. My GPA right now is suboptimal (3.2), and I want to raise it as much as possible before I graduate. But due to my low gpa, and other factors, I might not get into any school (or don't go at all) so I want to get the most out of my undergrad studies. There are some very interesting classes that I want to take like (2 of the following):

[Data Science and Analytics](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece498dsu/sp2018/administrivia/)

[Data Science and Engineering](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece398bd/fa2018/)  or

[Deep Learning](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2019/spring/CS/398)

but if I take these classes my GPA will most likely suffer. Or I could go the ""easy route"" and take an advanced R programming class and SAS programming class for my major. these classes seem easy enough but I don't think it will look good in my transcript based on course names.

There's a chance I won't even find a job that will use this kind of ML knowledge with only a Bachelors so maybe the easy route is better? Or maybe I'm overestimating the jump in gpa I could attain? any opinions are appreciated.

TLDR: easy route: raise gpa (maybe at most to 3.4?), possibility more free time to look for job, lose out on practical ML knowledge, more experience with R, Rcpp, SQL, SAS, doesn't look as good in grad app.

hard route: high chance of gpa hit, less free time, more python experience, have practical ML knowledge, wont learn SAS and other software, more prepared to tackle harder classes in grad school (maybe?)",datascience,1541740785,ayblue,0,1,True,2018-11-09,1,"Raise a low GPA or take harder classes if I want to go to a grad school (MS STAT/ Data Science)? i'm in my final year of undergrad and also planning for the possibility of grad school in the future.

Suggestions on Outlier detection for mixed (categoriacal + numerical) data,"**Problem:** Outlier detection

**About the data:**  
\- mixed (categorical + numerical)  
\- features may be correlated

**What I've done so far:**  
\- In order to keep things simple for the moment, I've discretized the numerical features and am treating them just like a categorical features.  
\- I've started off with the simplest possible approach - [Attribute Value Frequency (AVF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4410382) algorithm.  
\- I'm getting some results (kind of), but the problem with AVF is that it does not cater for correlations between different features.

**What I'm thinking of doing:**  
\- The [apriori algorithm](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori-Algorithmus) seems to be somewhat similar to what I need. But it is not meant for Outlier detection (low support regions) but for finding the mode of the distribution (high support regions).  
\- I was thinking of somehow using an 'inverse apriori algorithm' (if one exists) for my problem of outlier detection. After a quick search, I have noticed that people have indeed tried going in such directions.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTION:**   
\- Has anyone tried this approach before? If so, what is a good source that I can use.  
\- Are there any better approaches? (*NOTE:* I have almost no experience with outlier detection and therefore I might not know what I am doing)

"“People are expecting to see this result, so we have to give it to them somehow.” (Corporate politics and confirmation bias on steroids.)","Using a burner account since a couple work people know my normal username.

I’ve been doing more-or-less data science work for about two years at a very large, very established company. You would know the name if I mentioned it. I do some modeling but, honestly, most people just want graphs and tables of particular things they suspect would lead to something profitable.The requests are often something like, “Hey, I think there may be a relationship to XYZ and decreased customer churn. Can you throw together some views for me?”  The higher up you go, the less people trust fancy models that they can’t understand. They want a nice scatter plot that makes it obvious. And I get that. You gotta sell an idea somehow.

Anyway, I’ve started working on more high profile projects. One project started about 9 months ago and required getting a large data set from a vendor. This took months. In the meantime, more and more high level people started talking about it. The idea of the project was to show that action X would reduce customer churn. This was pretty much assumed to be true, and the analysis was necessary to figure out how much of action X, when, and how much benefit we could expect.

People got excited about this. SVPs we’re checking in on the status, anxiously awaiting the benefits. When planning for next year, many tacitly assumes this would bring a boost to overall sales and would help them meet more aggressive targets.

The only problem is they’re all wrong. We got the data and I’ve been crunching it for a month now. No matter how you model it, graph it, slice or dice it, this relationship they assumed existed doesn’t. Now the supervisor on the project is freaking out. We spent a lot of time on this and a lot of money on the data. People expect to see at least some kind of result. This morning, I was told that “we have to deliver what they expect, even in a small way. We can’t just say there’s nothing here worthwhile.”

I’m starting to feel like I’m expected to manufacture results that simply aren’t real. I don’t feel very comfortable with that. And since this started, I’ve noticed that similar problems are not uncommon. People use analyses based on sparse data and unsound conclusions to make convenient decisions. It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess I’d say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.

I already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect me—whether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. It’s really stressing me out. I’ve started drinking a lot more and it’s definitely hurting my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Advice?

It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess I’d say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.

I already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect me—whether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. It’s really stressing me out. I’ve started drinking a lot more and it’s definitely hurting my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Advice? Is this common?"

Next move for a data analyst / business analyst?,"I’m after career advice with a data science perspective.

My career background: I trained as a research scientist where I first learnt to organise and analyse data with Matlab. I left academia with the aim to join industry and apply my data analysis skills during the time when “data science” was on the rise. 

Via free online courses, I learnt R programming and took opportunities to code on the job. I essentially bypassed the use of Excel to organise and analyse data by using R. I worked in retail for three years using R to wrangle large sets of data and built dashboards with Power BI. On occasion, I would perform some data science techniques – regression, prediction, clustering, sometimes with Python. 

I am currently working in banking and primary use SQL, R and Tableau to answer business questions. I’ve been complimented on how I clearly present insights to senior stakeholders. Even though I know it doesn’t take that much to impress, I do feel like I am adding value to the business.

I am a data analyst who gets to sit with the business (not with other analysts who must go through multiple managers to understand what the business wants and needs).

This progressed my career beyond the world of Excel. 

Would love to get some opinions of what people believe I could focus on for the next year. Internet of things? AI? I can’t see myself learning data science or AI techniques to become specialised in either. Rather, I’ve enjoyed learning simple examples from such fields to showcase the potential benefits.

Closest Python Equivalents for Major R Packages?,"Hi all!

Model difference between Keras and Native Tensorflow,"For the purposes of creating data science articles for my personal website, I built a simple dense layer NN in both TF and Keras (with TF back end) to recognize the MNIST numerals.

The first model in TF performed sufficiently well (95%), and so I moved onto Keras to repeat the process. However what I found is that the identically defined model (same number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, optimizer etc) when learned using Keras performed absolutely terribly (9%). I was able to get a model that worked through a significant reduction in the number of nodes per layer, but I was surprised that this was necessary.

Is anyone able to explain the reason for this? My guess is that there are implicit things that Keras does generating a difference between the two models but I am not sure. An initial guess would be that the Keras model is over fitting, but that doesn't feel intuitively right to me either as model accuracy is low on the train data as well as the test data.

"Need suggestions regarding which language and library to use (R, Python, js, any other?) for changing x axis ticks with small images","Hey r/datascience, longtime lurker but first post here.

I have a question I've been searching for quite a while but I have not found a solution yet, so I''d like to ask you for your help.

So, I'm currently working on a project (using R at the moment) that currently works the following way:
- Perform surveys regarding product variations;
- From the surveys, select the variations we'd like to analyze (these may vary in quantity in each analysis as we so desire);
- R scripts takes in the inputs and processes the structured data and spits out graphs (using data in long format, plotting with ggplot2 currently);
- Graphs are then manually edited on a Powerpoint file so that an image of the product corresponding to each variation is underneath its corresponding codename in the graph.

We're at a point that we'd like to automatize almost everything but the very last part I'm having tremendous difficulty with. I can write code to read the variables we choose, select the corresponding image file [most of them are same size] from the main directory, import it to R, but I cannot seem to place the images either replacing the x-axis ticks of the ggplot or just below it [preferred] - I found a blogpost regarding country flags and tried the code but ratio of the images was odd and non-intuitive to adjust, at least for me.

In a first stage I'd like to know if anyone could help me finding how to do this using R (get coordinates for each x-axis tick and somehow place the image underneath?) so I could add to my R Markdown file and Shiny app [in the words] (or Python, though I'm less proficient on that).

Secondly, to deploy this inside a web-browser autonomously, what would you recommend? Not too familiar with other tools, so I was thinking on deploying Shiny app inside the website but might run a bit slow, not sure. Open to suggestions for other languages such as js or similar, but then we'd have to hire someone for that.

Cars without a driver and the search for true artificial intelligence," 

**Introduction**

The search for true artificial intelligence is the basis of the continuous development of cars without drivers. This is what you need to know about it.

What is true artificial intelligence? Whatever it is, experts and experts rush to clarify the fact that what we have at the moment is not.

“To get to the point where we have a true artificial general intelligence, we are a long way off. We are not even close to that, and researchers in the AI area know,” says Raveen Nao Intel.

Why are we so far? In short, building a true artificial general intelligence is very difficult because of one fundamental fact: intelligence is more than the recognition and the reaction of patterns. If there is only one image that represents intelligence, it is the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo.

**The paradox of intelligence**

The famous fresco The Creation of Adam shows God giving life to Adam, but the finger of God is not touching Adam (or Adam’s finger is not touching God, depending on how you look at it).

The level of logic and mystery and abstraction and actualization establishes the creation of Adam in the divine realms as profane both at the same time. Intelligence is the space between the finger of Adam and the finger of God. To ask, “How do you make negative space mean anything?” And the computer will certainly emit absurd; at least not produce an equivalent to the creation of response Adam. Go ahead, ask Siri.

When we try to create a true AI, we try to animate an artificial Adam, but for this to be possible, we need to create a paradox: a being capable of logical and illogical thinking at the same time. For abstraction and true intelligence to be possible, a mind must be able to withdraw from itself.

Autonomous cars are the most important and fundamental piece of the actual AI jigsaw puzzle that advances; The following will tell you why.

**Why cars without a driver matter**

In addition to being important to AI, cars without drivers are incredibly important for the future of driving and transportation:

* It could reduce the number of accidents by 90%, save lives and reduce the cost of medical care and auto repair.
* They could reduce emissions by 60%, which would help in the fight against climate change.
* They could free drivers to do other things, reduce stress, and catalyze productivity.

These are just some of the potential benefits of cars without a driver. There are others related such as improving the Internet of things and freeing up space in cities that have huge implications for how to build and manage our cities and infrastructure benefits.

**The problem for AI**

There is a big problem. This problem is not the only representative of the quest for true AI; it is the crux of the quest.

Should the AI be programmed without a driver to always comply with traffic laws? How does a car without a driver decide what to do when there is a choice between saving the person in the vehicle or saving a person out of the vehicle?

Here’s a scenario: A car without a driver transports a passenger across a bridge hundreds of feet above the depth of the water.

Suddenly, a driver on the approaching track falls asleep and his car enters the wrong lane, heading straight for the car without a driver at high speed. It’s late at night; the passenger in the car without a driver is also sleeping. If the computer woke the passenger and warned him, giving him the option to take control and make a decision, it would be too late and there would be a head-on collision.

What should the AI do? If you deviate to the wrong lane, you are breaking the law, and the other driver is likely to die because your impulse will send you to the railing. If you go ahead, kill the two people. If you stray from the road to the handrail, a collision could occur and could lead directly through the handrail and kill the passenger.

**Logic does not always apply to AI cars**

In this scenario, logical and algorithmic protocols do not seem to apply. Programming an AI to break the law goes against another programming, which is based on the law. If you encode an algorithm to break the law and release it with algorithms that respect the law, there is a possibility that the algorithms interact unexpectedly and unintentionally.

Even more: imagine that there is a human in the driver’s seat, not knowing what to do when the car approaches. The human instinctively steps on the brakes. The approaching driver suddenly wakes up and has time to get back on track because the uncertainty of the other driver gave him time to make the correction.

You cannot program artificial intelligence to be uncertain, because the algorithms are if-this-then-that; It seems illogical to step on the brakes with a car coming toward you, so in this case, the single, uncertain brain of a human is an advantage.

**The IoT factor**

AI cars are naturally connected cars, they are part of IoT, which may be the most important development in the 21st century. It is estimated that there will be about 50 to 70 billion IoT devices in operation by 2020.

Here’s the question: If cars without a driver could communicate with all the other cars on the road, if all cars had AI (even if they were not without a driver), it would seem that there would be no problem. One car could tell another to cancel a sleeping driver and stop.

However, IoT is vulnerable to attack. Cars can be mass-armed. But what if the cars had true generalized artificial intelligence? A car could have something like an immune system. He would know when he is attacking and initiate defence protocols.

**AI will win once he solves the paradox**

Driving presents the AI with a problem, that if it can find the solution, it will be smarter than the humans. Let’s say that for the car, it is always logical to make the right decision. So the right decision is logical. If you are an AI, how do you make an illogical decision that is correct, and therefore logical?

Great art like The creation of Adam has nothing to do with logic, it is not logical to think that a being who defies the laws of physics has turned nothing into something and created people who are bound by the laws of physics. However, the abstract and metaphorical thinking necessary for religion and art has created a language system that has allowed humans to thrive, so this kind of thinking has its own logic.

We may never be able to make AI think that way, but at least we are learning a lot about ourselves through effort.

Even more: imagine that there is a human in the driver’s seat, not knowing what to do when the car approaches. The human instinctively steps on the brakes. The approaching driver suddenly wakes up and has time to get back on track because the uncertainty of the other driver gave him time to make the correction.

You cannot program artificial intelligence to be uncertain, because the algorithms are if-this-then-that; It seems illogical to step on the brakes with a car coming toward you, so in this case, the single, uncertain brain of a human is an advantage.

**The IoT factor**

AI cars are naturally connected cars, they are part of IoT, which may be the most important development in the 21st century. It is estimated that there will be about 50 to 70 billion IoT devices in operation by 2020.

Here’s the question: If cars without a driver could communicate with all the other cars on the road, if all cars had AI (even if they were not without a driver), it would seem that there would be no problem. One car could tell another to cancel a sleeping driver and stop.

However, IoT is vulnerable to attack. Cars can be mass-armed. But what if the cars had true generalized artificial intelligence? A car could have something like an immune system. He would know when he is attacking and initiate defence protocols.

**AI will win once he solves the paradox**

Driving presents the AI with a problem, that if it can find the solution, it will be smarter than the humans. Let’s say that for the car, it is always logical to make the right decision. So the right decision is logical. If you are an AI, how do you make an illogical decision that is correct, and therefore logical?

Great art like The creation of Adam has nothing to do with logic, it is not logical to think that a being who defies the laws of physics has turned nothing into something and created people who are bound by the laws of physics. However, the abstract and metaphorical thinking necessary for religion and art has created a language system that has allowed humans to thrive, so this kind of thinking has its own logic.

We may never be able to make AI think that way, but at least we are learning a lot about ourselves through effort.

How to step data science game up ?,"Hi Guys, 

First, a bit of context. I am currently finishing my Master Degree in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Business Analytics and Machine Learning. I have a bit work experience through internships in Data Science (Python, R, SQL...), quite a good knowledge of statistics/econometrics and ML fundamentals and currently learning better the unix command line / basic sysadmin. 

However, browsing job descriptions, I realize I definitely lack the knowledge of the *full stack* of the Data Science pipeline. I still work more like a scientific researcher in a lab rather than a full-fledged data science in industry. I have no idea on how to put a model into production, nor do I know anything about tools frequently seen in jobs descriptions or used in real life such as docker, kubernetes, spark, AWS beyond the basics ...

I ideally wish to gather a  comprehensive understanding of the elements needed to put a model in production from end to end. (e.g., data retrieval and processing, alerting, errors and exceptions handling, reporting ...)

Advice for a transitioning math teacher,"I would appreciate hearing some opinions from those in the know about my future study and career plans.

**Background:**

I have a masters in pure mathematics from a highly ranked UK university. I did almost no programming at university and a little statistics. The focus of my masters was topology, manifolds, Lie groups etc, if that means anything to anyone here :) Of course I have studied Linear Algebra in depth and am really enjoying learning the statistics that is new to me. Since graduating I have been teaching mathematics at High School level in International Schools around the globe for the past 6 years. But now I am looking to try something new.

**Study so far:**

For the past 2 years I have been studying Computer Science topics and programming. I have taken Database Management Systems (MySQL) and Intermediate Software Design in Python through Foothill College online. Then I have done various MOOCs including CS50 and Stanford Algorithms. I am almost finished with ""Python For Data Science And Machine Learning"" on udemy and have really enjoyed it. It doesn't go into the mathematics, so at the same time I've been reading ISLR. I'm then going to go through ISLR once again but doing the exercises in R. I'm looking forward to then moving onto The Elements of Statistical Learning to really get into the details of the mathematics. I'm also picking up a lot more books when I'm home for winter break that I'm going to sink myself into :D

I have come to the conclusion that a career in Data Science is going to combine my love of mathematics, data, programming etc into one I will really enjoy and (hopefully) be good at.

**Personal situation:**

I will be working full time (studying in spare time) until June 2019. Then I am in the lucky position of being able to stay at home, whilst my (very supportive) partner works another year until June 2020. I will be both studying and being a parent (with childcare). I live in a developing country with few options for local experience in the field (though I need to research this further). The plan is then to move to my partners home city (Seattle) in the summer of 2020 and for me to find a job :)

**Options for the next year and a half:**

So I am currently weighing up my options for the next year and a half before we move around the globe. I have looked at some data science bootcamps and I could do similar stuff on my own: building up a portfolio, writing a blog, contributing to open source software, entering kaggle comps, building personal projects etc. The great thing is I will be able to go much more in-depth with the topics compared to a bootcamp as I'll have so much more time. The downside is I will not have the career guidance, interview prep, help with LinkedIn etc.

Another option I am looking at is starting the Georgia Tech OMS Analytics Masters. I do like the structured learning of a full university course and the course descriptions [sound really interesting](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics?section=curriculum). It does sound like it would be a real challenge to finish in a year and I think I would only be able to start Fall 2019.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'd appreciate any feedback, ideas, words of encouragement, thoughts on my situation.

Question about prototyping/implementation,"Hey data scientists,

I’m finishing up my masters degree and will be working on my thesis in the new year. A project I am considering for my thesis would be for a telecom company here in my country. They need to develop an NLP algorithm to classify the different types of bills they receive on a daily basis (around 5-8 different classes). 

My question is about implementation in a low level language. I plan on prototyping in Python, but am considering if I should also develop a first take on a C++ implementation for production. Does anyone have any experience with this?

Model loss functions: MSE vs MAPE,"Hi /r/datascience , 

Currently i am training a model and evaluating it with the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
Now, i am running into some problems with this. 
What i want to do is get the lowest MAPE. 

One problem is as follows. 
When the MSE is going down, the MAPE might oscillate within a magnitude of 10^3 . 
Now one would think: why not just use the MAPE loss function, if the a lowest MAPE is the goal?

This will bring up the second problem. 
For some reason using MAPE as a loss function is not working out for me at all. 
I'm using Keras and am working with a LSTM model, but that shouldn't matter i guess.
When using the MAPE as a loss function, i am getting values of like 60.000 %.... While using MSE as a loss function the best values i get are ~60%...

How should one tackle this problem and/or what is going wrong?
I'm having the feeling that this either is some basic question, or a theory problem. 
That's the reason i'm not posting any code right now.

The Role of Big Data in Creating an Advertising Network," 

![img](7mg7bg2wd1y11)

**Introduction**

Understanding the role of mass data when building an ad network is an essential step in having the most successful marketing and advertising possible.

Ad networks have become much more reliant on big data than ever before. A 2017 Entrepreneur article titled “How Big Data is Solving Big Advertiser Problems,” attempted to address these challenges.

Andrew Medal, the author of the article and founder of Agent Beta, said the big date is vital to creating personalized campaigns and improving customer orientation. To offer these solutions to advertisers, they need to develop a clear understanding of the customer’s footprint. This involves following clients individually as well as making observations about the customer based on similar demographic and behavioural factors. For example, ad networks recognize that it’s important to see how customers who search for different keywords on Google behave.

This allows ad networks to refine their targeting capabilities and deliver more subtle information to their customers. Understanding the role of big data in creating an ad network is very important.

**Big Data is more important than ever for new ad networks**

Selecting the right channel for promotion is the key to a company’s success. With the variety of ad types, companies face the difficulties of choice and do not always recover the result of the expected advertising campaign. Traditional advertising is losing its power and is not as effective as before. A recent Facebook case has shown that social networks are not completely honest with advertisers and that they hide inflatable ad metrics. According to ADOTAS research, 86% of consumers suffer from blindness to banners, a phenomenon when site visitors ignore ads. As a result, companies are spending money on useless ads and are not reaching the target audience. To solve the problem, many advertisers have switched to ad networks.

**What is an advertising network?**

An ad network is an online platform that connects potential advertisers, publishers, brands and customers so that the first ones reach the target audience on a network. These networks have been in the market for some time and have evolved over time into a complete ecosystem that not only gives businesses the ability to configure their ads correctly but also provides ordinary users with useful ads.

**Creating your own ad network**

With the increasing demand for this type of advertising, the number of networks grew. The market today has many brilliant examples that really give companies a CTR rate of 7-8%, which is quite high, compared to traditional banners (0.1-1%). Networks like Pop Slide, Easy Visual, or Cash Tree have already introduced their products to the global audience and bring together millions of people in a single system.

We asked a founder of the Easy Visual advertising network, Rafal Szymanski, to share his views on the future of advertising networks:

Advertising networks are changing the way we see ads. People spend more and more time online, which means they will probably reach their prospects through a smartphone or tablet that users unlock 80 to 110 times per day rather than putting banners on the street. These networks give companies the ability to target their ads according to users’ personal characteristics, which translates into actual views, relevant ads, and allows the brand to reach only customers at Easy Visual, we’ve created an app that spans a number of markets, including the US, Russia, Ukraine, South Korea, Poland, Germany, etc. and provides statistics on views and ad conversion rates. This network will be useful for various areas of the market and also serves as a source of traffic for mobile applications and services.

It is not so difficult to create your own advertising network, but you should consider the competition that is present in the market. 3 simple rules that any newcomer should follow in the advertising market:

**1. Analyse the market.**

Do not rush to Educate carefully and accurately the market and competitors, see what solutions have already been introduced and what opportunities are not yet being implemented.

**2.Attract the audience of future clients.**

When creating your own network, you should already have a user base that will result in potential customers for brands and companies. Customers will not use the network where they do not have people to serve their ads.

**3.Define potential customers between companies.**

Cosmetics, clothing, applications, electronic devices, the variety is infinite. Choose the right direction of the market that you can promote in your network.

**Do not ignore the importance of Big Data when creating an ad network**

When creating an ad network, you’ll need to incorporate machine learning, predictive analytics, and other Big Data solutions for your products. Keep this in mind and optimize your network accordingly.

Deciding on the best way to forecast call center volumes? (R/Excel/simulation),"So I've run out of people to ask so thought I'd ask here. I've been tasked to improve the accuracy of my call center's call volumes from now on. The current method is basic ""guestimating"" using historical data and excel spreadsheets. This however impacts the accuracy down the line need for capacity and scheduling.

I heard that using either: triple exponential smoothing, ARIMA or multiple temporal aggregation will be great for this. As far as I know, Excel struggles with this. Therefore I decided R will be my best solution. I've done a few experiments and I'm able to create graphs using R's time series analysis. I'd like to export my results as a csv for further use though.

Is there a way to do this? Am I going about this the right way? I've tried other techniques (trends, regression, etc) but it's an emergency call center so it's hard to predict.

Constrained Probabilistic Matrix factorization coding question.,"I'm stuck, really stuck, my brain has decided to go full stupid on solving this problem.

And I'm currently trying to build out the Constraint PMF model. I'd like to be able to do this batches. So intead of reading in all the data, I want to read in part of the data, do it's thing, read in another chunk of data, do it's thing, and so forth (similar to how the paper does it.)

However, I'm stuck at this one part: 

$U_i = Y_i = \frac{\sigma I_{ik}*W_k}{\simga I_ik}$  

I'm stuck trying to figure out how to do this part in batches. 'cause it seem like the W matrix needs to be fully updated from **all** the data first before we can start updating the User matrix U. How do I go about doing this update in batches

Gettin in to datascience,"Hi guys. I know we alredy got a buch of posts like this but i want to receive some love too.  


I am 29 years old, Brazilian and i work on a plubic bank from 10 am to 16 pm. Altough i have a good job and a good salary (for my Country standarts) i fell unhappy cause i really dont like what i do. I accualy like the company i work for and i would love to work with data science at this company. My company do have a big tecnology sector but i didnt manage to get in yeat. I am currently doing an techinical degree at distance(he have this in Brazil, is like 2 years and a half to graduate, i alredy did 1 year) in programming, it is very easy, i do at home but i fell that my evolotuion is very slow at this course.   


I did the free descritive statistics course on udacity and i am reading ""naked statistics"", i also did politics science as my first graduation before a started work at the bank and i really like statistcs applied to politics at the time so i think i am on the right track to a carreer that i enjoy.

I am considering doing the Udacity data science courses since i have the money. At the time i studied something like 3 hours every day (and then i play overwach with friends for 2 hours). I am having my first child at January and time could start being a problem, but i will cut down overwacht first :(  


  


1- do you guys think is too late?  
2 - 3 hours studie per day is little time? 

3 - do you guys recommend udacity? Is there another plataform that could speed up my learning progress.  
4 - what eles could i do to speed up my progress?

Testing in Data Science Machine Learning,"Hi all,

I am currently working as Automation QA and doing some basic coding and building automation frameworks, recently had an opportunity in my organization to do testing for Data science and machine learning team and did not want to miss that as I want to learn and grow my career towards Analytics or ML engineering so I did Python for Data science course on edx, learning on Kaggle as well and nailed the interview as it was very basic questions on understanding of evaluating models(F-score/Confusion matrix etc.) and classifying data. 

So my current tasks involve testing integration of DS models into Software Engineering and creating custom test data sets to evaluate the behavior of the models in terms of performance &amp; accuracy. I am looking to learn more on QA methodologies for Data Science any resources will be very helpful. We do NER with sci-kit learn.

I would like to ask if my thinking is wrong and how should I change it. I am trying to fit an Archimedes spiral to given data points.

"Not New to DS, But Still Overwhelmed...Impostor Syndrome Perhaps?","Using a throwaway for this anxiety induced wall of text, but looking for advice, as I feel like I'm drowning a bit. I'll give a quick summary of where I came from, where I am, and where I'm going for context:

BS in Risk Analysis (IT/Stats type hybrid) in '10, since then I've worked in the US intel community doing all kinds of fun stuff, used my background to help pioneer some pretty cool data innovations for one of the big three letter agencies. I consider myself more a intel analyst/data analyst combo, but my job title has been 'Data Scientist' on a number of occasions, enough that I'm known as a Data Scientist in the USIC (again, non-tech people assigning titles here). I'm half way through my MS in Data Science from a well known university. I'm also looking to transition out of DC to a smaller town (Philly area), and as such would probably leave my roll in the USIC where I have built quite a good reputation....

Jumping back into the job market has been a bit of a shock, and I attribute this mostly to the complete lack of awareness surrounding the definition of 'Data Science'. For every 10 job postings for Data Scientists that I've looked at, I feel like everyone is a completely different job and covers such a wide set of skills that I feel woefully underprepared for any of them. 

I have a good grasp on statistics, I can code/know R/Python/VB/SAS/SQL (although I wouldn't consider myself 'coder fluent', I can figure out anything, it just takes time and some SO/google-fu), I'm a capable business person (I've briefed to high level stakeholders, can communicate and write well, etc...), my critical thinking/data munging/manipulation I would class as 'expert'.

Opinion on Alteryx?,"I work for a larger company and they have invested in both Alteryx and Tableau.  The data we use is stored on SQL servers and API's from our Vendors.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be in charge of building models, putting them into production, and proving why these models are useful. Most models will be baseline models, so do not need anything complex beyond boosting/random forests. Once I get the models in to production, I will be tasked with training analysts on how to use the model. I will also train them how to update the model and other higher level activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we already have Alteryx and they're set on using it (analysts use it for ETL). I am tempted to work with that since it seems intuitive and sufficient enough and would make it easier to train others who do not have programming experience.  Also, the integration from Alteryx and Tableau is kind of nice when I need to create visualizations to prove the success of the model. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have experience with it and do you prefer using it for ETL/Model building or do you stick to a programming language?

Brainstorming how to best help a small Marketing firm with Analysis. Entry Level.,"I'm interviewing for a new, small and rapidly growing marketing firm (10 people). The boss seems to like me. They make money by having investors support them as long as they produce good returns on their service.

The firm is currently supporting a nonprofit charity and is advertising to find donors for the charity. The amount of money the firm raises for the charity, and the firm's satisfaction ratings from the charity are the metrics investors are using to decide how much support to provide.

I just graduated with a B.S. in mathematics with probability and experimental design courses in Statistics. If I'm given the job, the Salary will be $30000-$35000 a year.

Can you help me brainstorm what sort of analysis I can do to find trends to improve satisfaction rating, receive more money from investors and generate more revenue for the charity?

1) look at the categorical and quantitative features of the investors to see which features and interests are associated with more funding and continued funding. Figure out the potential for investment based off investor net worth and contributing factors.

2) Figure out what other areas the investor would like to support. Find out metrics that return the most benefit to the firm's investors.

3) would I use surveys to gather this data along with individual research?

4) Identify potential investors with similar traits to  current investors.

5) Examine demographic data the charity collects to identify target audiences

6) Create surveys figuring out what contributes to satisfaction rating

7) Perform an analysis like a split plot to determine what advertising methods work the best with which demographics

8) Do a cost/return analysis of various advertising methods.

9) Have the sales team members keep short logs of how they interacted with potential donors to see which metrics have the greatest effect on donation amount relative to the theoretical amount that donor could afford and/or relative to the median/average donation, and use this to inform the Boss to make decisions in Sales training off his instinct/experience/this data.

Designing a capstone project for a data science MOOC,"Hi everyone,

Here are some things the team has been debating:

* Should the project be assigned (How many options?) or should learners have the freedom to pick their own dataset and project? Do we provide a dataset and let learners answer their own question from there?
   * If we assign a training dataset or project, we would have a testing set and grading could be easier.
* Should there be weekly goals/milestones or just a final submission at the end of the course (2-4 weeks) without any kind of guidance/structure?
   * If a dataset or project is assigned, it would be easier to have the same milestone or quiz on the data for everyone.
* How do we grade the project (and smaller milestones, if any)? Does everyone get peer graded? Do only paid certificate learners get graded by teaching assistants/the instructor?

Big Fashion joins Big Data: How the fashion industry benefits from Big Data," 

https://i.redd.it/yh322ypfk8y11.jpg

**Introduction**

The fashion industry benefits from the big date in an important way. See how data and technology come together to make customers more stylish.

Many of the readers are not in the fashion industry. However, those involved in the Big Data industry should note the $ 2.4 billion fashion industry; an industry that has experienced an annual growth rate of 5.5-7% in the last decade. Big Data is tapping into aspects of the industry that go from design to resale. In addition, most people in the world connect with fashion on one level or another and with styles that fit their individual expressions.

Among the real estate, construction and manufacturing industries, the retail industry has historically been the slowest in adopting technological advances. It was Amazon who entered the game and began to make great strides employing such things as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Even the older brands began to pay attention to Amazon’s disruption.

Countless industries have jumped to the Big Data band for years and the fashion industry is the last to do it as well. Big Data’s compatibility with the fashion industry is based on three key aspects: extremely high data volumes, reliability and variety. The greater the volume of data generated, the greater the quality of data assimilated by Big Data technology.

**The failures in traditional retail analysis**

Fashion houses and traditional brands collect crucial data, such as inventory details and sales records; they were strictly kept in the company. This devotion to the dark caused those working in the industry to do so in a proverbial silo, which made many of the colours, styles, settings, and other design metrics become scattered and unstructured data. In addition, the industry had no crucial pieces of the puzzle, such as competitive analysis, prospects, trends, prices and other vital details.

**Big Data and Fashion Quality Control**

Pattern recognition \[1\] (not to be confused with image recognition) is a subset of artificial intelligence. Combined with Big Data, pattern recognition is being used by companies to protect the integrity of their brands. The integrity of the brand is not only maintained through quality control but also through the struggle to prevent counterfeiters from spreading the replica’s fashion.

In 2017, the Office of the United States Trade Representative published its Annual List of Notary Markets in which it stated: “Imports of counterfeit and pirated physical products are estimated at about half a billion dollars or about 2.5 per cent global imports “. New technology companies are approaching to solve a problem that has affected the fashion industry for generations: counterfeit goods and pirated goods.

From fake Rolex watches to replicas of Gucci clothing, as well as anything and everything in between can be found at online retail giants like eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. Kim Smith, a content marketer at Good Firms, a software research and analysis platform, said, “Fake has been around for a long time, but with the latest technology available and small details that can be replicated, it’s on the rise. Anything can be fake, from luxury products to businesses and consumers, to videos and audio “.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that approximately 10% of medical products sold in underdeveloped or developing countries are counterfeit and of poor quality. Some experts believe the percentage is much higher. And while it is difficult to measure the exact impact, a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh and commissioned by the WHO has found that counterfeit or substandard medicines are directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year.

**Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and New Fashion Trends.**

Finally, the fashion industry, like many other industries, has faced the possibility that machine learning and artificial intelligence replace human designers. And while artificial intelligence robots have not yet taken the place of Giorgio Armani, technologies like IBM Cognitive Prints are helping designers with their new ideas.

&amp;#x200B;",datascience,1542174979,shalinipriyaram20,0,1,True,2018-11-14,1,"Big Fashion joins Big Data: How the fashion industry benefits from Big Data  

https://i.redd.it/yh322ypfk8y11.jpg

**Introduction**

The fashion industry benefits from the big date in an important way. See how data and technology come together to make customers more stylish.

Many of the readers are not in the fashion industry. However, those involved in the Big Data industry should note the $ 2.4 billion fashion industry; an industry that has experienced an annual growth rate of 5.5-7% in the last decade. Big Data is tapping into aspects of the industry that go from design to resale. In addition, most people in the world connect with fashion on one level or another and with styles that fit their individual expressions.

Among the real estate, construction and manufacturing industries, the retail industry has historically been the slowest in adopting technological advances. It was Amazon who entered the game and began to make great strides employing such things as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Even the older brands began to pay attention to Amazon’s disruption.

Countless industries have jumped to the Big Data band for years and the fashion industry is the last to do it as well. Big Data’s compatibility with the fashion industry is based on three key aspects: extremely high data volumes, reliability and variety. The greater the volume of data generated, the greater the quality of data assimilated by Big Data technology.

**The failures in traditional retail analysis**

Fashion houses and traditional brands collect crucial data, such as inventory details and sales records; they were strictly kept in the company. This devotion to the dark caused those working in the industry to do so in a proverbial silo, which made many of the colours, styles, settings, and other design metrics become scattered and unstructured data. In addition, the industry had no crucial pieces of the puzzle, such as competitive analysis, prospects, trends, prices and other vital details.

**Big Data and Fashion Quality Control**

Pattern recognition \[1\] (not to be confused with image recognition) is a subset of artificial intelligence. Combined with Big Data, pattern recognition is being used by companies to protect the integrity of their brands. The integrity of the brand is not only maintained through quality control but also through the struggle to prevent counterfeiters from spreading the replica’s fashion.

In 2017, the Office of the United States Trade Representative published its Annual List of Notary Markets in which it stated: “Imports of counterfeit and pirated physical products are estimated at about half a billion dollars or about 2.5 per cent global imports “. New technology companies are approaching to solve a problem that has affected the fashion industry for generations: counterfeit goods and pirated goods.

From fake Rolex watches to replicas of Gucci clothing, as well as anything and everything in between can be found at online retail giants like eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. Kim Smith, a content marketer at Good Firms, a software research and analysis platform, said, “Fake has been around for a long time, but with the latest technology available and small details that can be replicated, it’s on the rise. Anything can be fake, from luxury products to businesses and consumers, to videos and audio “.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that approximately 10% of medical products sold in underdeveloped or developing countries are counterfeit and of poor quality. Some experts believe the percentage is much higher. And while it is difficult to measure the exact impact, a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh and commissioned by the WHO has found that counterfeit or substandard medicines are directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year.

**Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and New Fashion Trends.**

Finally, the fashion industry, like many other industries, has faced the possibility that machine learning and artificial intelligence replace human designers. And while artificial intelligence robots have not yet taken the place of Giorgio Armani, technologies like IBM Cognitive Prints are helping designers with their new ideas.

Priyanka Agrawal, an IBM Research India researcher, said in an interview: “Fashion designers are working hard to create new designs that can create trends.

“In addition, they have inspirations like architecture or technology, which they intend to translate into their work.” However, it is increasingly difficult to do something new and interesting; we wanted to make it easier for them to increase the design life cycle.

Non-STEM postgrad as a data scientist,"Using a throwaway.
The context is that I've been working for about a year out of college in a small analytics startup, and I'm applying for postgraduate studies for either next year or the year after. My core interest has always been urban planning and architecture: I dropped out of architecture school and went to CS because I hated how design decisions were made without any awareness of evidence as to what works for users. I'm considering going back to school for an urban planning program with a strong design focus, but in a school that has a strong tech community, and I intend to continue working on all my projects from a data angle. 

The place I'm working has a really lean team, by which I mean I'm the only guy who knows what's really needed to run the tech side of things besides my project manager, who isn't as involved in the product design. The senior data scientist has experience, but none of it has been in working in a production environment, and faced with the task of setting up a proper CI pipepine here he's shown very little interest, and I've had to deal with it alongside vendors and my project manager. Meanwhile, the actual ML side has been very ad-hoc, practically pre-sales engineering where we slap shit together to try to close deals even before we're done building the final product platform. Move fast, break things still requires some manpower and organisation...

Consequently I'm learning a lot about setting up infrastructure in a scalable way, consulting contractors, ex-bosses, and colleagues from past internships and going to tech meetups which are thankfully very numerous in my city. But I worry that going to a non-quantitative postgraduate course would dilute my credos as a technical guy. I want to spend more time than I'm able to looking at tools like Hyperopt and getting more experience actually bringing business-critical data projects through the whole process of ETL, modeling, crossvalidation and so forth, but half the time I'm tied up with infrastructure development and testing while my senior data scientist spends three weeks in a row fiddling with hyperparameters for a single client that he's manually tuning and tracking in Notepad. Once I'm confident in setting shit up for production I want to go somewhere where I can focus on ML use cases, ideally actually related to urban problems... But I'm worried that getting a non-STEM postgrad would hurt my career.

I could attempt to do the same by going to a CS or math program and angling my projects from an urban perspective... but I think the outcome would be quite different. I'd love to work with places that deal with urban use cases like Sidewalk Labs or the Geo team, but I'd love to work at tech shops that have to figure out what's happening and what to do with communities that have some kind of direction, like Discord as opposed to Facebook. Going all the way back however, my original goal was to find a way to shake things up in the big engineering and design firms like Arup, Mott Macdonald; urban planning and design consultancies including government offices, and even architecture firms. The plan was always to be credible by accomplishing stuff in data science before trying to enter that industry, but even with that there's also a lot of resistance to outside suggestions if you're not a professional in that sphere, like an engineer, architect, or urban planning. So a postgrad in that area seems important to some degree.

I guess I'm looking for some insight and opinions on what you think the best way to look at this conundrum is. How bad does it look if it all doesn't pan out and I stay in STEM jobs at STEM companies? If I'm not working in urban planning and design, I don't have much patience for non-tech companies, tried that schtick in bulge bracket and hated being a second-class citizen in the company ecosystem. Diving into ML research on a STEM masters would be self-indulgence, I'd love to do it but it keeps me away from my goals...

* should the DS team be centralized as a shared service or should analysts and/or scientists be embedded within disparate business units?
* who should the team direct report to?

* should the DS team be centralized as a shared service or should analysts and/or scientists be embedded within disparate business units?
* who should the team direct report to?

My questions are founded in wanting to ensure that we (the firm I work for) build the team for success, and on a personal note, if I end up at another firm I want to be close to the DS team.

Thank you, MG"

Stuck in career local minima,"I'm desperate and looking for advice. This is very long and may sound pretentious, but please try to understand me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 years old, almost 27. Got a bachelors in physics from local university in South America and luckily got into an applied physics masters in an ivy league school. Struggled, but graduated with a GPA that can go on a resume. Then, decided physics was not for me and learned about data science through MOOCs. Got my first job in an early stage startup in my home country after 4 months of study (my scholarship didn't allow me to stay in the US). Got frustrated with the lack of guidance (just two technical people: a software engineer and I) and changed to a big consulting company after 7 months. Worked there for 6 months. Lot's of politics, questionable practices and unprofessional coworkers. The technical people were..  weak and I felt like I was the most senior person that could be called DS there (not my merit, but company's demerit). So I quit and joined a second 1 year master's program (CS with DS focus), in Europe (which has affordable education). One semester of courses later I got an internship that was partnership between university's lab an tech company. In the company no one had a clue about ML and the lab professor was nice, but not able to do much outside his ML math (example: in the first week he told me I could use his C implementation of MLP for my text classification task).

&amp;#x200B;

During and after my internship I applied to lots of jobs. Got countless rejections and 3 offers. 2 big tech companies and a startup where the only DS was leaving. I chose the one that seemed best, one of the big ones which seemed to have a fair amount of other DS. I started this week and I was able to see some code from my peers and.. wasn't really what I expected. Some questionable methodologies from both machine learning and software engineering angles. Yesterday my boss made it clear in a meeting that he thinks GloVe is an library with a word2vec implementation. The overall vibe of the office is also unpleasant to me and there are some other personal stuff that makes it harder (everyone I care about, including gf is 7000 km away from me or more).

&amp;#x200B;

This will sound weird, but I miss having a reason to feel the impostor syndrome. When I was studying physics, there was always people so much smarter than I was, from which I could learn and hope to be as good one day. And now for years I feel surrounded by not so competent people. And this is not because all smart brains are in physics and dumb people go to DS, but because only the ""dumb"" ones offered me jobs. I'm sure there are a lot of DS 3 years younger than me who make more money than I do in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad software engineering skills. I have never really studied classic algorithms. I mean, I wouldn't be able to pass a software engineer whiteboard interview. I never really used SQL in real world. In all my experiences I had csv or json files.  I can do some queries after doing some hacker rank, reading w3 schools and transferring knowledge from R or Pandas. I can't put a model in production. I never used AB testing. Most of what I did was similar to Kaggle competitions or Kernels with some additional steps before and after. I know the real basics of pyspark, but again never had to use in real life. I think I am very good at problem solving with machine learning, I have a good practical and theoretical understanding of ML, I could spot issues in most ML problems I saw in the past and I did well in many ML competitions.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm stuck in a local minima. I cannot get jobs where I'll work with smart people cause I'm not that good, but I cannot get better because some things are just tough to learn by yourself. I've tried to give ""momentum"" by studying by myself, but it only helped until a certain point. I'm far from everyone I care about, with an idea that in Europe things would be better career-wise, but I didn't land the job that would fulfill me in that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not dumb. I achieved many things most wouldn't. Everyone I worked was very happy with my work. But I am stuck. I'm afraid to have another 6 months of less experience in my resume and that no one will hire me because I don't stick around. I feel like quitting my current job and this is my first week. I'm afraid in a few months I will have more time experience, but less value to time ratio (""so you have 3 years of experience as DS but can't put a model in production, don't know about a/b testing, no real experience with analytics, don't know shit about spark, hadoop, docker and all those technologies that sound like pokemon names?

&amp;#x200B;

Some details of my failed interviews:

Most application processes start with a take home task to do some EDA or maybe ML. I passed all of them, but then in the interview I sucked and got rejected. In one company (#1 in their area, where data science is core) they said my task was one of the strongest they had ever seen, but still my answers in the interview were vague (this one was more data science analytics). I agree with them, as I had no experience with a/b testing (important for them), had only heard about multi armed bandits and couldn't answer well what the distribution of revenue per user should look like. In another one, again I passed the task and in the technical interview I was able to answer questions related to the tech around a ML model in production. The feedback was I was too junior (although this was literally a 'data scientist junior' position and I had previous experience). For another one I passed the first technical interview after the task, and got rejected in the last one after a lot of questions related to optimizing delivery algorithms. For another one they wanted someone either with better software engineering or deep learning skills. For 2, I failed classic coding tests. For 3, of them I got rejected after apparently passing all technical. For many I didn't even get interviews.

Unpaid internship advice,"Hi,

I will keep this as short and simple as possible: I am a junior (junior age wise, little behind in credits) studying Statistics and CS at a large state school with a decent program in both. 

I am actively looking for an internship for the summer in the data/software area (data analyst, data science, software dev/engineer, etc.) to gain experience, since my resume is pretty weak (one data entry ""internship"", no side-projects (WIP), customer service jobs, no clubs). I have applied to 30+ places and have gotten denied at about 10 so far. I am applying to a ton more to this day and will through the winter/spring.

I have heard back from a ""Data Science internship"" which is ""unpaid/for credit"". It is with my state's major league soccer team. I feel I am relatively qualified  (pretty familiar with R/Python when ""some experience"" is a requirement). They want to set up a phone interview soon.

I guess I am posting because I don't know if I should be careful since it is unpaid. I've heard very negative things from a lot of people about unpaid internships in this field. However, I am not too confident I will find anything better, and I really want to gain actual experience. I work a part time serving job and a campus job so I should have some kind of income for the summer. If I did end up getting offered a position, what can I expect? Is it worth it? Does anyone have any experience in these kind of situations? Any feedback is super helpful and I appreciate it.

**Note:** I posted in this sub because I wanted input from people in the actual field. If it would be better to post in r/jobs or a CS sub I will do so. Thank you!

"Input on my ""data pipeline"" architecture","**TL;DR: Can I skip Kafka/HDFS/Spark for my real time dashboard events and send events from my apps API to time series database which I directly query.**

Hey, I'm not really in the big data or data science world but a requirement of a mobile application I'm building is to see live stats from users. These starts are not generated a lot really, only on user register, on game start, game end.  At first I was doing Kafka + Hadoop (HDFS) + Spark but this was pretty complicated. 

I'm starting to reach my deadline for this task and kind of getting desperate. I wanted to send events to Kafka and have consumers just push them to S3 in Avro file format for long term storage as well also sending it to a Time Series Database (InfluxDB) for querying from Garfana. However, even with just trying to get my Kafka consumers to work is being difficult. I'm wondering if I can just send my events directly to my time series database and periodically backup my data to S3 via that DBs backup tool and cronjob. Essentially removing the Kafka buffer. I can monitor the system and see how it's performing so I know how urgently I need to iterate to phase 2 with a more robust system. Our user base is &lt; 40,000 and only 1 person (internal) will be using the Grafana dashboard for app analytics.

Hey, I'm not really in the big data or data science world but a requirement of a mobile application I'm building is to see live stats from users. These starts are not generated a lot really, only on user register, on game start, game end.  At first I was doing Kafka + Hadoop (HDFS) + Spark but this was pretty complicated. 

I'm starting to reach my deadline for this task and kind of getting desperate. I wanted to send events to Kafka and have consumers just push them to S3 in Avro file format for long term storage as well also sending it to a Time Series Database (InfluxDB) for querying from Garfana. However, even with just trying to get my Kafka consumers to work is being difficult. I'm wondering if I can just send my events directly to my time series database and periodically backup my data to S3 via that DBs backup tool and cronjob. Essentially removing the Kafka buffer. I can monitor the system and see how it's performing so I know how urgently I need to iterate to phase 2 with a more robust system. Our user base is &lt; 40,000 and only 1 person (internal) will be using the Grafana dashboard for app analytics.

Data Science and Finance,"xpost from r/MachineLearning

Is anyone really interested in macroeconomics/finance/investment? I had a backup idea for my data science course that my group decided not to go with. That's actually a good thing, because what I had in mind seems to be close to impossible. (this is just hobby work, or future project ideas)

What I have so far is just webscraping Yahoo, looking at different markets like stocks, bonds, currencies. I have some other Python notebooks with other ideas, but this is the gist.

All I really notice thus far are patterns that I've heard about before, temporary alignments that come and go. My idea was to use machine learning somehow, but I feel like that's about as far-fetched as any other indicator.

I guess I was looking for certainty, but that I figure is also nearly impossible if not completely impossible. Just looking for some people who may have an idea or two about how to use data science to do some prediction on the financial data.

Negotiating Analyses,"A soft question about doing analyses in industry. My issue is that I’m fairly bad at collaborating on analysis with other analysts and managers. I want to become better at it but I don’t know how to navigate the “soft” side of these things.

It is my experience that seemingly simple analysis requests (stuff like “we noticed a change in X in markets M1 and M2 after we introduced Y, is it a good idea to implement Y in all remaining markets?”) will devolve quickly. Questions get changed, scopes increase mid-analysis, the analysis answers completely different questions, the requesters themselves don’t know what they need to see in order to be convinced of anything, fellow analysts and superior will tell you to change things but yet explain why it makes sense. I normally end up asking a lot of questions that people ignore or hand-wave away and then get stuck because nothing is clear anymore.

I’m doing a poor job at explaining this because it’s still nebulous in my head. But I guess my question is how have you navigated human nature to complete analyses and/or projects with the least amount of friction? Do you have any tips or rules of thumb to help you avoid wasting time or being derailed by people?

Questions about a Masters Degree vs a Job in Data Science/Data Engineering,"Greetings Data Science Geniuses! #flattery  


I am at the point in my life where I have to make the decision between heading for a masters degree vs getting a job. There are of course many factors affecting such a decision but I purely want to focus with this post on the straight forward advantage a masters could provide over simply working in the data science/engineering field and vice versa.  
Just as a heads up, after the first question, I will use data science as short form of saying data science/data engineering.  


1. What is the difference between data science/ data engineering in simple terms, and what does my current student job(mentioned below) qualify as?  

2. Is pursuing a masters degree in data science better than finding an entry level job with a bachelors degree in the same field given my current education? To build further, is knowledge in data science more important than experience in the field?  

3. Are my current qualifications enough to start a serious data science job?  

4. This is more of a regional question, but I didn't seem to find many job offerings with the title 'data scientist'. What other job titles are used that imply a data scientist generally,but especially in Europe/Germany?

Below is general information about me as to help with your advice!

* Educational Background:

I am an international living in Germany who's almost done with his bachelors in Information Engineering(Mixture of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering). I have quite the programming knowledge in Python, SQL, R, Java, C++, C; all at an intermediate - expert level.

*   
Working Experience:

While studying I had mainly 2 student jobs. The first one lasting a year was in mailing server development for various customers (did it just for the money at that point).   
The second and most important job is the one I am doing currently for the last 2 years which is working at a semiconductor company in R&amp;D where I develop tools based on Spotfire(templates) to automate data analysis of large chunks of data so that the R&amp;D can make their decisions. It only recently came to my attention that what I am doing could be considered data science(engineering?) and where I learned my fair share of python and R and got comfortable with both of them(I have a strong programming background so learning languages was never an issue for me). In this job I also developed by software designing skills where questions like efficiency of implementations and optimizations come up a lot.

Transfer learning - identify one of 120 dog breeds by a dog’s photo.,"My idea was to use transfer learning by applying a neural network trained on the ImageNet dataset to our particular task. ImageNet is an image dataset which contains more than 14 million images of more than 1000 classes. Neural networks trained on this data are extremely good at extracting all kinds of useful features from the images. So I would take such a network, remove its softmax layer and build my own much simpler network on the top of it to get the predictions. This way I would save days of training which I would need to train a convolutional network from scratch.

Still, using only one ImageNet pre-trained neural network appeared to be not enough to achieve the required performance, so I ended up using three networks of different architectures: ResNet50, Inception and Xception.

The resulting architecture looked like this: 

https://i.redd.it/x2946oxwuiy11.png

During training I divided the network in two parts to reduce time consumption: first I extracted and stored the features using each pretrained network and then used the stored features as an input to the trainable part of the network. As a regularization to improve performance on the test set I used two dropout layers.

Resulting performance I achieved was 85% on the test set. Investigation into incorrect predictions showed that in some cases more than one dog or humans were present in the image or a dog was partially obscured by other objects. These as well as the cases where a dog was difficult to distinguish from the background my network couldn’t deal with.

The network was implemented in Python using Keras framework with Tensorflow backend.",datascience,1542299692,behindthedash,0,1,True,2018-11-15,1,"Transfer learning - identify one of 120 dog breeds by a dog’s photo.

Data Science Interviews - Attrition per Stage,"Hey All, 

  
As you may guess from the title, I'm deep in the data science interview process and just got a confidence-crushing rejection.   


As such, I'm wondering if you all have insight into ""Attrition"" of the interview process. For the purposes of this question, I think its best to condition the problem by only considering applicants who got called back. The rate of resume application to call back is so variable and usually such a crap shoot if you apply online that I don't see it as useful.   


I'm also assuming a standard interview structure of:  
(i) Phone screen, usually with HR

(ii) Technical Screen, usually with Data Scientists  
(iii) on-site interview  
(iv) Offer  


So, what do you think is the fraction of applicants who get a phone screen to those who get a technical interview (e.g. 50% of phone screened applicants get a technical screen)? What fraction of technical screens get an on-site? And what fraction of on-sites get an offer?   


Currently, I'm pretty good at (i) -&gt; (ii) with only 1 out of 7 that didn't invite me to the next. But with technical screens I'm 1 for 3 with more pending. I haven't gone to my on-site yet.

Looking for resources on using clustering outputs as input to a classifier,"Hi all,

Have seen a few projects that use this approach, particularly for text classification. The idea is to 1) group similar text documents together (using e.g. levenshtein distance or word2vec embedding distance thresholds) to determine text document clusters. Then, 2) use the cluster identifier as a feature for a classifier to predict membership in some other class of interest.

There are some clear pitfalls to this - 

1. How do you determine a cluster id for a document that you've never seen before?
2. Do you run clustering once for your training set, once for test set? But then you have the same problem as 1) above where you can't determine groups for new documents.

So my question is - are there any academic treatments of this approach and the various problems that come up? Or some useful blog posts? Looking for theoretic foundations of the problems here - perhaps some ways forward!

I've written the following article about the HR issues with hiring Data Science roles.

[Career] Physics of mobility and Data Science,"Hi folks and sorry for another career choice related post.

I am currently at a crosscroads. I have finished my Masters in physics and was offered a PhD position on the physics of mobility. It is mostly theoretical research on how people migrate, and how certain transport modes (taxis, trains ride-sharing) behave at different scales. It involves a lot of simulations, and some data analysis, although nothing like deep learning.

Now my short-term goal is to contribute to science, in general, having some form of impact on society.

My long-term goal however is to ""not starve"", and not to jump from post doc to post doc, never really sure whether I will be sent to get another position. So I want to enter Data Science after my PhD. My question to you is how possible it is , with a niche field such as mobility physics. 

Is it okay to take the PhD position, or should I rather hope to get accepted for a PhD in a field like machine learning? Which is much less likely for me. ( Only top 25% of my class/cohort, almost no formal education in deep learning, only a few lectures on basic machine learning, data science and computational neuroscience)

For several reasons I have to stay in Germany, so the options in ML research are limited. ",datascience,1542394791,EmbarrassinglyNaive,7,1,True,2018-11-16,1,"[Career] Physics of mobility and Data Science Hi folks and sorry for another career choice related post.

PyData DC 2018 Conference Recap,"Hi all and happy Friday!

Today was the first day of the 2018 PyData DC conference, and it was great to get to hang out and chat with so many fellow data science folks (some of whom mentioned this sub in conversation)!

For everyone who for any reason was NOT able to make it to the Friday session of the conference (there are two more sessions Saturday and Sunday), I have put together a full write-up, including notes, links, code, etc., that covers half of the sessions given today (it was a split session conference so I could only attend 4 of the 8 tutorials).

You [can find this complete write-up here](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/blob/master/conferences/py_data_dc_2018/pydata_conference_notes.ipynb), which I have added as another section to [my repo that covers a variety of goodies in the data science toolkit](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit). 

Big thanks to all the presenters--this was an awesome start to the conference and they all killed it!

Looking for insight on Data Analysis on these job description,"Hi everyone,

I'll keep this short because I was just finishing up this post and I got a blue screen, and lost everything I had typed for the past hour. hahahah dear god, here we go again. I'll laugh if the diagnostic test crashes my PC. Sorry for the format or misspellings in advance, I just want it to be done.

 Basically I'm going to start applying for jobs on data analysis, and I need insight on whether what I'm preparing myself with is useful or not. Some information about myself. I'm 23 and a night time college student doing a BSc CIS. Recently I just finished a course on SQL, and found the whole design and visualization of data to be super fun and interesting. So much so that I've decided that this is something I want to pursue. Work experience was a part time job fixing and selling computers, been doing this for about a year now, and found it really boring since every thing that was damaged was the same 4 things, specially RAM. Left it about a month ago, and with my free time I've been finding more about the data analysis profession. 

Now then, I'll List what I've been doing with my free time to prepare for the job, this will have things that I think are needed and those that I think would be fun to have some knowledge of. Afterwards, ill link and paste the description of 1 job listing that I feel has the most things in common with the rest job listings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things that I've been teaching myself are:

\-Statistics

\-SQL and Excel (I did take courses on these two but it was to general)

\-Power BI

\-Classification: Decision Trees and Model Evaluations 

\-Starting this today. I'm looking to run some linear regressions to see the relationship between advertising costs and their expenditure. 

\-I've lined up to learn Six sigma and their methodologies. But I'm not sure if it worth learning this yet.

\-Intermediate knowledge on Visual C# and basics of Java.

\-Down the line I'll look into R or Phyton.

\-I've seen VMware pop up in some job listing so I have it on the list of things to know about.

\-Hadoop analytics and Hbase (saw some listing that had these and I want to know if they're needed)

&amp;#x200B;

And that's about it, on things I'm doing. I saw somewhere some predictive analysis on determining the infected outburst of diseases, and I thought a similar project could be fun to better understand the spread of diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

NLP classification problem using TensorFlow sentence encoder and other parameters as features," I have 150K tagged samples of technical support chats between customers and technicians. The chats are classified into 2: “resolved”/ “unresolved” sessions (66.6% and 33.3% of the distribution respectively).

Based on this data I am building a model that would predict the resolution for each chat once it ends.

So far I tried using sklearn.svm.**SVC** with the following measurements as features:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The tensorflow based sentence embedding of the entire sessions (512 dim vector)
2. The tensorflow based sentence embedding of the first question asked by the user (512 dim vector)
3. The length of the session - min\_max normalised
4. average message length of customer - min\_max normalised
5. average message length of technician - min\_max normalised
6. The overall number of interactions throughout the session - min\_max normalised

Additionally, as the SKlearn library is rather slow I am only using a portion of my data (\~30K samples)

So far results have been bad - all the predictions (100%) are of the bigger “resolved” classification.

What can I do to improve this model?

Maybe I need to use a different tool?

"Anybody did the final exam for ""Introduction to Python for Data Science"" on EdX from Microsoft? Have a question about it.","Hi,
I just reached the final exam in thi course, and have a question about it.

If you did it, can you tell me if the challenges are based only on the videos of the courses, or if they also cover the final labs?

In case anyone is wondering, my question is because the final labs cover knowledge that is not presented in the course, and are incredible more complex than anything else there.

Honestly I'm appaled by the  course. It is basically the same content that Datacamp offers (It is actually one of the DataCamp courses) and it's of a very basic level.

The way grading works is that there are some questions on EdX after a video, followed by a ""lab"" in Datacamp, and these are all rather simple and always take you by the hand a lot, to the point that is nearly impossible to not score 100%

EXCEPT that the final labs in the course are  rather complex, and there are questions that need solving with VERY complex Pandas features (That is if you don't know Pandas) that are never explained in the course.

Not to mention some exercises _ONLY_ accept a certain string as a solution (E.g, df.groupby['column'] is wrong but df.groupby.[""column""] is right.

Accepted to JHU for MS in Data Science. Worth it?,"TL;DR below

For some background, I come from a liberal arts undergrad and city planning for grad school background, so no stats/econ/computer anything. I'm in a bootcamp now that's covering R, SQL, Tableau, basic stats, etc., and hoping to land a job after that with a local company when it finishes in February. However, I'm starting to be a bit concerned about how well I'm actually prepared coming out of this bootcamp, as talking to recruiters has given me the impression that a lot of getting hired comes down to a technical interview/demonstrating some business knowledge, and I don't really trust my skill level coming out of this bootcamp to do very well in a situation like that (not a knock on the bootcamp, just a statement about my base level of knowledge going into it and how much one can possibly learn when going through so many topics so fast).

Currently I'm working at a job also totally unrelated to data, so I would need to get a job after this bootcamp to start getting experience, and continue to study on my own time, but knowing myself I would have a hard time blocking off time to study via MOOCs, etc., without the pressure of a grade and the support a more formal program might provide. However, the program seems a bit technical in nature, and doesn't seem to focus on Python or the nitty gritty details of SQL, but rather on the statistics and computing side, with some data visualization thrown in, but the advantage  is that it's online and part time. Given my background, is it important/worth it to pursue education in the field in a more formal setting like this, or is this the wrong way to go about it?

pharmacist wanting to study master in data science," Has anyone from a medical background gone back to studying and retrained themselves to become a data scientist? I am a pharmacist by training, have been working in pharma for the last 9 years in various commercial and clinical roles, I'm very interested in data science and it's application to real-world patient data, i.e. electronic medical records, claims data. I feel that there is a shortage of people who understand both healthcare and data science, hence this might be a good field to study. I know it will be very difficult in terms of the academic rigour, so I'm looking into a couple of full time Master Programs (links below). I am just wondering if anyone from a medical background has picked up data science after having worked for many years in healthcare? And how did you find the transition, particularly the academic rigour?

In terms of my background in maths, I have done some undergrad stats and calculus in my pharmacy degree over 10 years ago, which i have forgotten and then a bit more stats in a postgrad pharmaceutical economics course 4 years ago. However, I do enjoy maths and algebra.

Scraping Lyrics and Analyzing Word Repetition,"Last summer I was listening to the new Arcade Fire album ""Everything Now"", and got a bit annoyed by how the lyrics seemed lazy and repetitive. So I wrote a python script to scrape lyrics by artists, and count what % of words were repeated based on the total number of words. Lo and behold, indeed ""Everything Now"" had the most repetition.

I wrote up a tutorial back then based on my method in case anyone else was doing some lyrics data mining. I recently picked up the example again, and used it as an example to try hosting a lambda script in AWS using the Lambda Gateway.

So I thought I would share that here in case anyone wanted to checkout some musicians! I'd be happy to talk through how I did it as well if anyone has question.

There have been 10+ seasons of the show and so my thoughts were assigning a particular skill set to them based on their progression through the show (and outside factors like social media etc.) Just not really sure how I’d start this. 
Transition Into Data Science,"Hi guys,

"As a business analyst, what can I realistically do to stay relevant in the future?","Hello! Hopefully this hasn't been asked too many times already. 

I was at a Google Cloud Platform training seminar the other day as my company is beginning to adopt it for our day-to-day use. One of the speakers (manager of DS at another firm) mentioned how they had high preference for software engineers, because *""its easier to provide DS tools to a coder than to teach an analyst how to code""*. 

With the exposure of DS I've had over the past year or two, I've gathered that the general sentiment is to code and be great at math/stats. When I look at the influencers in this space, I see people with PhDs in math/physics or some sort of proven programming background. 

As for myself, I graduated with a business degree and I've maintained a career today because I'm well-versed in web/mobile analytics. When I perform my analysis, I'm essentially using analytics platforms (e.g. Adobe/Google), SQL when looking at online-offline data and spreadsheets to discover insights; like any BA would.

However, in my space, I'm slowly noticing data scientists build presence in the business space; like unicorns that can code, run models and *present analysis + insights.* And when I'm looking for other web/mobile related jobs, Python and R are already job description standards. I feel that BAs won't have the competitive advantage to compete against data scientists with software and/or doctorate backgrounds in the near future. 

Today, I try to chip away at Datacamp or Python when I can. I've managed to get some basics down, like accessing APIs or running basic regression models. But I treat Data Science like a hobby, something I do for a few hours to a dozen a week (if I'm feeling it). Nonetheless, I don't have it in me to follow the footsteps of what accomplished data scientists have been through. 

What can analysts like me practice and build in our ""playbook"" to stay relevant without having to pour 20+ hours a week to hone the craft? Or is DS a subject matter you can't just ""half-ass""?

Sorry for the long read and much thanks for any insights that come through!

Questions regarding social network application to sports,"So I'm building a player passing network of a football game. similarly to what has been done multiple times (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6904.pdf). However, in all examples I see:
1) the players are connected if they have passed to each other, there is only one connection even if they have made 20 passes with each other
2) the weight is used to indicate the amount of passes, high weight = many passes. Everyone seems to make this assumption but I don't understand why its done that way. Shouldn't weight be high if its a ""difficult"" path, or a longer path? So shouldnt the weight be the inverse of the amount of passes?

3) additionally when calculating some metrics that use shortest path between nodes. In football every player has often performed atleast one pass to another player, so usually its a fully connected network. Can distance be described using the average distance of the passes between two nodes or something? Sure the goalie has succesfully made a pass to the striker, but this pass is very risky, and most likely the shortest path to the striker is in fact through defender, to midfielder to striker.

Tool for sharing visualization with many users,"Looking for help. I have a database and need to compile the data in graphs to send to 200+ users.

Good “low hanging fruit” ideas to impress non technical BI/Reporting managers,"I’m currently on a business intelligence team which is effectively a rebranded financial reporting team at a financial services company. My long term career goal is to pivot to a data analyst and eventually data scientist role. I think I’m on the right track for that (currently applying to part time masters degrees in stats, and I have some econometrics and programming background), but I need a little advice for my near-term steps. 

Basically, the work my team currently does is mostly in Excel and Business Objects. It’s a fairly non-technical team, just a lot of churning out spreadsheet reporting; I’m the only person who has any coding background (or statistical experience for that matter). 

I have access to Python, R, and Tableau currently. My goal is to start doing some analytics type work over the next few months, with the goal of shifting my role enough that I can try to push for a new job title/official role for myself, probably as a data analyst. I want to do a couple of things:

1. Automate some reporting in Python to help reduce the total amount of grunt work
2. Produce some light analytics work that would impress management

Like I said, currently there’s basically zero exposure to analytics of any kind currently, just basic reporting, so I think there should be some low hanging fruit I can exploit. Even pretty simple analytics would be new and hopefully mind blowing to my non technical team, especially if it delivers some real value. 

My question is: does anyone have any tips for some good models/starting points for a team with zero exposure to analytics? Our business is centered around our network of financial advisors, so I’m thinking of analyzing things like advisor productivity and retention based on variables like firm size, age, gender, etc., probably focusing on Python as my primary tool. I’m just looking for the best way to start with that basic analytics that would still look impressive and useful to a non-technical managerial team. 

Not expecting someone to hold my hand or spoon feed me anything, I’ll do my own homework, I’m just fishing for general thoughts/tips.

How to choose between MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering vs MS in Computer Science for a Data Science specialization?,"I am interested in applying for an MS education, primarily in the USA and Canada.

* I have 2 stellar letters of recommendations. 1 from a mid-level manager and 1 from a senior director (different  but equally good companies).
* My bachelor's degree was in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
* My grades in college were not very good. Slightly below average and wildly varying between semesters and subjects.
* My best letter of recommendation from a professor is lukewarm at best.

Advice on Matrix Principal Components Analysis,"Hey everyone,

I've been reading through a [paper](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1109/BigData.2015.7364011) which carries out a PCA on a matrix where both the row indices and columns are variables, in this case the columns are time of day and the rows are day of the year.

Path to master's degree,"Hi Reddit!

Brief introduction – I work in finance, like my job and have a very decent salary. However, good things don’t last and I’m becoming increasingly worried by AI/machine learning technologies, which may well replace my job in a not so distant future.

Therefore, I’d like to differentiate myself from the crowd of future jobless finance guys by completing a master’s degree in data science/machine learning. Now, you may wonder, why a master degree? Well, I work in a country (not the US) where degrees are highly recognized. Moreover, I do not want to become a data scientist but rather *signal* to future employers that I know finance and data science/machine learning. In my country, Coursera certificate, nanodegree and the rest are not recognized at all.

I was hoping that you could provide me with some guidance about 1) which online degree I could do 2) how I should prepare for it. Big caveat: I have a wife, two kids and a lot of work I can realistically spend no more than 10-12 hours per week on studying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some master's degree I'm considering**

\- The famous OMSCS of Georgia tech. Good reviews but seems actually quite hard for people without programming background like me.

\- The online master of computer science of the Illinois University. Kind of like the OMSCS but more expensive.

\- Harvard Extension school: good to get a certificate but getting a master seems very tough.

\- Master of computer and information technology of Upenn on Coursera: good for people without computing background but rather expensive and quite selective.

\- Master of data science from the University of San Diego: looks good on paper (10 hours per week, credit from the micro master are transferred) but has not launched yet.

Any other ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get there**

Here are the MOOCs I have done so far (I have only attended business courses at the university):

\- Machine learning (Coursera)

\- Python for everybody specialization (Coursera).

\- Deep learning specialization (Coursera).

\- Data science bootcamp (Udemy).

&amp;#x200B;

And here’s what I plan to do:

\- Linear Algebra Foundations to Frontiers (edX).

\- Calculus 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Coursera).

\- Fundamentals of computing specialization (Coursera) (not sure that’s the best choice; are algorithms necessary?)

\- Some probability course TBD.

What do you think?

Data Science Education - Looking for help! (LONG POST),"Hello Guys!

I am an 18 years old guy from Hungary, who is going to finish secondary school this school year. (in June 2019 to be precise.)

I have been looking at a Danish university called IT University of Copenhagen (link) to study Data Science there. It is actually free for EU citizens, so I would not need to pay tuition fees, only the living costs, which are a higher than here in Hungary, but I think I could afford it with the scolarship offered by the Danish goverment.

As application approaches I am starting to question my decision about moving out to Denmark and studying there.

I was hoping you guys could give me some advice, tell me your experiences or something.

So...

As I mentioned I am 18, and currently I have a girlfriend, with who I have been together for almost 1.5 years now, and it is a really serious relationship, we are planning long-term (I know lots of people say this but we REALLY are...)

This really makes it a lot harder for me to move out to a foreign country to study, but for a long time I thought it would be worth it. Now as I said, I am getting a bit unsure about this.

My first plan was to move out, get the BSc and the MSc degree in 5 years, come back and live happily afterwards.. but my god, 5 years seems like forever. And neither of us really wants to do this anymore.

So I feel like I have 2 options really.

1, I go to Denmark for 3 years, get the BSc, come back home, and start working with it, and try to build a career with work experience, not with a very cool diploma. (I mean a BSc is also cool but be honest, an MSc would be way more benefitial.)

2. I stay for a BSc here in Hungary, with which I can later apply to a foreign university (potentially this one in Denmark) for a MSc degree and then come back home. (I didn’t mention - I would like to live and work here in Hungary in my future.)

My questions for you guys would be the following ones :

- What do you think a BSc would be enough for these days from the university I have previously mentioned? (IT University of Copenhagen - itu.dk) Does anyone ever heard/experienced anything good/bad about that uni?

- Is it worth to do a MSc in Data Science? Because I have read hear many different things, many people say you can self-teach it yourself from sites like Coursera. Is it worth the 2 extra years? What are the values you get when completing a MSc? Do you get remarkably better job offers and salary if you have an MSc degree?

- Is it possible to build a career from work experiences and a BSc (in this case it has 2 outcomes) if
  a) the BSc is from the ITU in Data Science?
  b) the BSc is from a Hungarian university in software development or something like that?

I think that is it for now, thank you so much for your attention, and if you have read it the whole way, YOU DA REAL MVP!

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your answers in advance!

Rapid Plotly: A workflow tool to rapidly create Plotly graphs,"I've been using the [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) library for a couple of years now in professional settings. Over this time, I created some templates which I use to quickly create plotly graphs, and I turned them into a little open-source project. 

It is just a little Python package which allows for the use of the awesome Plotly library without having to write tons of code. It has sped up my workflow, hopefully others will find it useful as well. 

You can see the project [here](https://github.com/def-mycroft/rapid-plotly) on Github. 

The below is the first part of the README on [Github](https://github.com/def-mycroft/rapid-plotly):

The [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) library facilitates the creation of beautiful and interactive graphs. However, it can easily require several hundred lines of code to create a presentable Plotly graph. Writing hundreds of lines of code every time a graph is needed isn't feasible for professionals whowork with data and it isn't fun for people working on side projects.

Use rapid\_plotly  to quickly create beautiful and interactive Plotly graphs, or use as a starting point to create your own toolbox of Plotly graph templates.

Current features:

* Functions designed to rapidly prototype Plotly graphs.
* Option to view graphs in Jupyter or to write graph to an html file.
* Barplots, optionally grouped, with error bars and custom hover text.
* Scatterplots, with custom hover text and option to overlay multiple datasets.",datascience,1542667100,dasenbrj,1,1,True,2018-11-19,1,"Rapid Plotly: A workflow tool to rapidly create Plotly graphs I've been using the [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) library for a couple of years now in professional settings.

"For those of you working on research, how do you track work?","I had a conservation with my manager about how to tract progress on research.  Part of the issue is that internally, we use JIRA, which uses tickets to track work.  If you're a software engineer, ""write X class"" is a concrete task with an obvious closure point, and it's unlikely to spawn additional work.

With research, it's often unclear when a project is finished, and projects often spawn a ton of subprojects.  For example, if you're researching ""How do we detect whether a user saw an ad on TV?"", exploratory analysis will inevitably spawn subquestions, like ""How do we know at what time and place an ad was shown?"", which would then spawn ""Can we bug the advertising company to give us the data we need to determine at what time and place an ad was shown?""  This would be one branch of subquestions among many.  Some of them turn into dead ends, some of them are fruitful, and we might decide that some just aren't worth exploring.

Weird Glitch With Ipod touch notes,"Hey guys, I know this might be off topic but I was wondering if I could get some feedback from you pros out there.

So about two weeks ago, my ipod notes crashed. It showed a brief view of my last viewed note before crashing, and boom, it crashed.

When I reopened it 150+ notes gone. All the way down to 0. When I went to storage, notes did not take up any space when it previously took up 2.5 gb of space. However, although it did not show, the storage left stayed the same before and after.

Now, just some more details, they did not get saved into icloud, or my mail, since the notes were locally stored. They are in the ipods hardrive somewhere.

So this is where it gets more interesting I guess. Since my ipod is jailbroken I was able to look at the files. I found the sqlite file, and viewed it, it did not show any of the notes. I searched every crevice for the notes in the filesystem and nothing. 2.5 gb into nothing.

But it wasn't over, so then I did a spotlight search and boom, they were there. I searched up keywords from my notes, and they were there. When I clicked on it, nothing, the notes app would open and display 0 notes. 

So I did probably the most stupid mistake of my life. I first made a backup of the old notes file. Then deleted it, and allowed ios to make a new file, since i though maybe it just needed to reconfigure itself. I went ahead and replaced the contents of the new file, with the old one and this is where it all went wrong.

Did a spotlight search, nothing. Not even a single trace. When I went back into the file system, I noticed ios made two notes files. 

When I checked the storage it remained the same. And finally i decided to connect to itunes, and it showed documents and data 2.5 gb. 

I went with my final attempt, data recovery center. It cost a grand and I just received an email, saying they were unable to find what I was looking for. So i gave them some keywords, and I am crossing my fingers for their results.

So my questions are:
Can they be recovered?
Is it possibly that all I did was overwrite them, even with the same storage numbers?
Can data recovery centers read internal memory addresses?
Can carved strings contain the notes?
Can the encryption on the ipod prevent data recovery?
Can I sue apple?
Can somebody help me.

Script Optimizations?,"Hello r/datascience,

I'm new to ds, but not inclined towards it. Have learned scraping, cleaning and basic analytics for my pentesting tools. Also make scripts from the ground up - because different areas and uses (so no scrapy or other kits for scraping).

Basics: While writing scripts, I needed additional functionalities like argument parser, progress indicator etc.. So import argparse, tqdm etc. Python gets quite easy in this way because all of this is a headache in C/C++.

Problem: Everything is slow! The site response time is good enough, not using proxies or different user agents, the latency is not an issue but the processing site gathering values is.. 

Stuff like beautifulsoup and requests run fast enough, but when compared to the same script written in C (gcc optimized output), python is not just a bit slower, but the difference is significant.

Idk if anyone here compared their scripts, but my C script takes 10mins to gather the data, sort it and analyze it, whereas my python script takes 13 mins without error checking &amp; 15mins with error checking.. Note that the data is just in MB's and not GB.. Each extra value is increasing the time difference.

So, also make VB/C# console app for same stuff and hell, .net loads all kinds of junk in memory, then it creates a seperate thread for UI, so have to create a background asynchronous thread that works seperate from UI.. or else the form will freeze while it does everything for 20+ mins!! Yeah, thats C# for you, even after all double buffering &amp; layout suspension.

So, is there a *faster* alternative to Python,C#, Vb etc.. which is not coding 1K lines of pure C and assembly code.. 

Damn, I evem tried embedding Assembly inside C to make it faster. Changing some registers and using load effective address(lea)..

Getting Started in DS: Am I doing it right?,"Hey everyone, happy early Thanksgiving!

I’ve been interested in getting started in DS for a few months and about 45 days ago started to move in that direction.

Since then I started the Data Science Career Path on DataCamp and have completed 4 courses out of 22 so far.

I have also begun reading the book, “An Intro to Statistical Learning: With Application in R” (ISL). I am in the 3rd chapter, Linear Regression, right now.

My background: I majored in Communication and Spanish with a minor in Psych. So I have some light statistics work through my quantitative courses, dabbled in SPSS and Decision Trees.

I’m currently applying to MS programs in Analytics... NC State, Iowa, Rochester, and Northwestern.

I want to make sure what I’m doing has me on the right path.
I want to end up as a Data Scientist, I know there’s a lot of hype around the term right now, but I’m looking to make sure I learn the skills necessary.

So right now I’m thinking about sticking to Python and working almost solely in Python, maybe picking up R in March or April.

Any recommendations for how to really position myself for success?

I had an odd experience today at a job interview,"I don't have a background in CS. (background in Math and Statistics) I also don't have relavant experience, and very little programming experience. I applied for an internship and went for the interview. First of all, the interview lasted for 1 hours and 15 minutes! They asked about my background, some technical questions, my personal background and future plans. Here's the thing: I applied for a Data Scientist internship position. They don't really even need a DS because they don't have data yet! They actually want a python programmer. Which I'm kind of good at. They're also not a big company, in fact, they are only starting out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was under the impression that statistics is what most data scientists around the world have majored in. Today I was told that someone with my background should not want to become a DS. Why? Because knowing the theory is not as important as knowing how to code. Who should go for these jobs then? CS graduates. I was told I don't know what I want, and that what I think DS is is not what it actually is. I was told that Statistics majors just use tools and don't know how to program. I was told that libraries do the job of statisticians. I held my tongue here: I really wanted to point out that libraries are actually stuff that make the life of the programmers easier... but I didn't.

BS in Econ &gt; Investment Banking &gt; Data Science?,"Hey everyone. I’m a 25 yo M interested in a career in Data Science and have some questions.  I have a BS in Econ from a top 50ish state school. I have spent the last 15 months working for a small boutique investment bank in M&amp;A Advisory. I was long shot to get into Banking but hustled into a job. Since, I’ve switched firms once and I’ve climbed in rank twice from intern to analyst to associate in those 15 months (partly due to my performance and partly due to dumb luck and the need arising). I got great experience and learned more than most get to in 3 years in IB. However, I’m feeling pretty burned out on Banking. It hasn’t really shaped out to be what I thought it was and I’d like to move towards something more like data science. I took a fair bit of math, stats, and econometrics as well as a bit of coding in undergrad and did extremely well in them but did not graduate with a good overall GPA (sub 3.0). I may be taking a job soon in Sales/Operations/Data Analysis closer to home with a large government contractor soon also. 

What paths could someone like me use to break into the field? I need to brush up on my stats and coding regardless, but what gives me the best shot at a data science job? Should I get a Master’s degree? If so, in what? Econ, Stats, Data Science? My Alma mater offers a Master’s in Professional Studies of Data Analytics, a Master’s in Information Sciences and Technology with a concentration in Data Science options, as well as a graduate certificate in Business Analytics. There is an online option as well. Would a Master’s even make sense given my GPA considering my past and potential future work experience?

What about boot camps and online courses? I’ve heard good things about Udemy’s Data Science courses. 

Finally, my last question is a bit odd but what are the regional characteristics of job options? One of the things that kind of burned me out on Banking was the notion of spending my life in NYC or SF to further my career. I’m not much of a city person and don’t want to be locked into Silicon Valley forever. I’m okay with smaller cities particularly in the South and Mountain West.

His final book recommendation  - a book about ""Design Thinking"" is very surprising - he says  


&gt;Being a person who’s done a lot of data analysis, one thing that I’ve found frustrating is the lack of proper mental model for what is going on when you analyse data. Most universities have a class called ‘data analysis’, and typically it presents various useful tools, but rarely discusses what actually happens when you do the analysis itself. *Design Thinking* gives a mental model to describe what happens in this process

"Bored data analyst wants to get into data science, but worried I lack the background knowledge/skills","Hi everyone,

I've been working as a data analyst for a medium sized company for just over 2 years. I don't have a maths/statistics/CS background, I studied biology at a leading university during which I had a little exposure to R (nothing I really remember) but that's all. I managed to wrangle my job through a contact and have learnt everything on the job.

I've found myself very bored in my job recently and am struggling to find a way of advancing my skill set any further. It seems as if the only career progression I could really make at this company would be going into management or project co-ordination. The bosses don't seem committed to investing any time/resources into any real cutting edge data analysis, when a request comes up it's quicker and easier to hack something together in SQL/VBA that kind of works rather than doing anything sophisticated. A lot of time is spent simply maintaining legacy systems and it's hard to find a business case for anything particularly creative or cutting edge when what we're doing at the moment works fine. Although I'm sure they'd love someone who is skilled in data science to offer solutions, nobody in any senior position has any experience with things such as statistical analysis or machine learning, so there's nothing driving any development in these areas and nobody to mentor those of us that want to explore these areas. I'd love to learn and develop my skills in Python/R but without anything to apply it to and no time at work to learn the skills I can't see how this would happen. I was promised that I would be using these technologies when I was offered the job but that hasn't transpired, and I don't want to fall behind in my skills compared to the rest of the workforce.

I know that I need to look for another job, but I'm worried that my lack of background knowledge and lack of experience with the more data sciencey side of things will hold me back. In fact a lot of job postings specifically ask for stats/maths degrees and experience in languages that make me feel like a dinosaur. I have strong SQL skills, and experience with cubes, data warehousing, Tableau/PowerBI; the majority of my work day is spent writing SQL code, validating data and generating data reports (and I also inevitably end up doing stuff which isn't really my responsibility like dbadmin/operational jobs). I've tried teaching myself some Python (primarily pandas) when I can but I rarely have time to do that at work and it's difficult without a project to can apply it to and with nobody I can speak to about it.

I really want to break into data science but I worry that my lack of any real world experience with commonly sought after skills, and my lack of a statistical/mathematical background will make it very hard to find the right job outside of my company.

Any advice on how I can break out of this funk would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",datascience,1542877007,PurpleRainOnTPlain,9,1,True,2018-11-22,1,"Bored data analyst wants to get into data science, but worried I lack the background knowledge/skills Hi everyone,

I've been working as a data analyst for a medium sized company for just over 2 years. I don't have a maths/statistics/CS background, I studied biology at a leading university during which I had a little exposure to R (nothing I really remember) but that's all. I managed to wrangle my job through a contact and have learnt everything on the job.

I've found myself very bored in my job recently and am struggling to find a way of advancing my skill set any further. It seems as if the only career progression I could really make at this company would be going into management or project co-ordination. The bosses don't seem committed to investing any time/resources into any real cutting edge data analysis, when a request comes up it's quicker and easier to hack something together in SQL/VBA that kind of works rather than doing anything sophisticated. A lot of time is spent simply maintaining legacy systems and it's hard to find a business case for anything particularly creative or cutting edge when what we're doing at the moment works fine. Although I'm sure they'd love someone who is skilled in data science to offer solutions, nobody in any senior position has any experience with things such as statistical analysis or machine learning, so there's nothing driving any development in these areas and nobody to mentor those of us that want to explore these areas. I'd love to learn and develop my skills in Python/R but without anything to apply it to and no time at work to learn the skills I can't see how this would happen. I was promised that I would be using these technologies when I was offered the job but that hasn't transpired, and I don't want to fall behind in my skills compared to the rest of the workforce.

I know that I need to look for another job, but I'm worried that my lack of background knowledge and lack of experience with the more data sciencey side of things will hold me back.

Looking for advice about which data science curriculum to choose.,"Hello, I'm currently unemployed and I have the possibility (through the unemployment office in my country) to maybe be accepted into one of two data science programs. 

One is called the AI Data Developer and lasts 7 months (full time) with a 12 months apprentice contract at the end. I don't have all the information but it involves data processing, cognitive API, AI development, production and interface, soft skills, project management. The person I spoke to mentioned that there will be classes in python, R, and C++, databases, machine learning, SQL and that there will be certificates obtained (how useful or transferable they are I'm not sure).

The other is called Big Data designer - AI lasts for 50 days or 400 hours so by my estimates around 2-3 months. And at the end there is a permanent contract. They teach python (though I'm under the impression that perhaps they already expect me to know that, it's called python review), machine learning with SciKitLearn, Hadoop, Spark, something called Kafka and Elastic and also some project management and agile methods. Link in French: https://www.devenez.fr/pdf/Programme-formation_Concepteur-Big-Data-Intelligence-Artificielle_Fitec.pdf

I'm strongly leaning towards the latter as it is shorter and I'm not super young (mid thirties) and I'm thinking that any deficiencies in the program I can probably try to compensate for myself (I have a scientific background and am not a stranger to self learning, I've done some stats and linear algebra, lots of R courses (as well as scripting writing for work), I know how to code a bit and have done intro to statistical learning and a little bit of the Andrew Ng course). 

The latter course also posts a salary (30-40K euros) whereas the former they didn't say. But the former may be more rigorous (they are also partnered with Microsoft so I don't know if that's a plus). It appears that they both do many similar things. 

Anyway, I know that without an actual syllabus for each one, it would be hard to decide and I unfortunately don't have access to such documents. 

What do you guys think? Any help would be welcome. Sorry if this is all a little nebulous, I still have to pass the interviews and we'll see if I get even one, LOL.

Statistics question on data cleaning,Your data set has missing values. Further examination tells you that they are spread along 1.5 standard deviation from the median with distribution mean = 0 &amp; variance = 5. How much data would remain unaffected(in %)?,datascience,1542892425,ksajan12,4,1,True,2018-11-22,1,Statistics question on data cleaning Your data set has missing values.
